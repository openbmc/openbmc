Subject: [PATCH 27/63] [Patch,rtl Optimization]: Better register pressure
 estimate for loop . .invariant code motion

Calculate the loop liveness used for regs for calculating the register pressure
in the cost estimation.  Loop liveness is based on the following properties.
We only need to find the set of objects that are live at the birth or the header
of the loop. We don't need to calculate the live through the loop by considering
live in and live out of all the basic blocks of the loop. This is based on the
point that the set of objects that are live-in at the birth or header of the loop
will be live-in at every node in the loop.

If a v live is out at the header of the loop then the variable is live-in at every node
in the loop. To prove this, consider a loop L with header h such that the variable v
defined at d is live-in at h. Since v is live at h, d is not part of L. This follows i
from the dominance property, i.e. h is strictly dominated by d. Furthermore, there
exists a path from h to a use of v which does not go through d. For every node p in
the loop, since the loop is strongly connected and node is a component of the CFG,
there exists a path, consisting only of nodes of L from p to h. Concatenating these
two paths proves that v is live-in and live-out of p.

Calculate the live-out and live-in for the exit edge of the loop. This patch considers
liveness for not only the loop latch but also the liveness outside the loops.

ChangeLog:
2016-01-22  Ajit Agarwal  <ajitkum@xilinx.com>

	* loop-invariant.c
	(find_invariants_to_move): Add the logic of regs_used based
	on liveness.
	* cfgloopanal.c
	(estimate_reg_pressure_cost): Update the heuristics in presence
	of call_p.
