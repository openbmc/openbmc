Subject: [PATCH] gdbserver ctrl-c handling

This problem was created by the upstream commit 78708b7c8c
After applying the commit, it will send SIGINT to the process
group(-signal_pid).
But if we use gdbserver send SIGINT, and the attached process is not a
process
group leader, then the "kill (-signal_pid, SIGINT)" returns error and
fails  to
interrupt the attached process.
