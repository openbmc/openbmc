Meta-security
=============

The bbappend files for some recipes (e.g. linux-yocto) in this layer need
to have 'security' in DISTRO_FEATURES to have effect.
To enable them, add in configuration file the following line.

  DISTRO_FEATURES_append = " security"

If meta-security is included, but security  is not enabled as a
distro feature a warning is printed at parse time:

    You have included the meta-security layer, but
    'security' has not been enabled in your DISTRO_FEATURES. Some bbappend files
    and preferred version setting may not take effect.

If you know what you are doing, this warning can be disabled by setting the following
variable in your configuration:

  SKIP_META_SECURITY_SANITY_CHECK = 1

This layer provides security tools, hardening tools for Linux kernels
and libraries for implementing security mechanisms.

Dependencies
============

This layer depends on:

  URI: git://git.openembedded.org/openembedded-core
  branch: master

  URI: git://git.openembedded.org/meta-openembedded/meta-oe
  branch: master

  URI: git://git.openembedded.org/meta-openembedded/meta-perl
  branch: master

  URI: git://git.openembedded.org/meta-openembedded/meta-python
  branch: master

  URI: git://git.openembedded.org/meta-openembedded/meta-networking
  branch: master


Adding the security layer to your build
========================================

In order to use this layer, you need to make the build system aware of
it.

Assuming the security layer exists at the top-level of your
yocto build tree, you can add it to the build system by adding the
location of the security layer to bblayers.conf, along with any
other layers needed. e.g.:

  BBLAYERS ?= " \
    /path/to/oe-core/meta \
    /path/to/meta-openembedded/meta-oe \
    /path/to/meta-openembedded/meta-perl \
    /path/to/meta-openembedded/meta-python \
    /path/to/meta-openembedded/meta-networking \
    /path/to/layer/meta-security "

Optional Rust dependancy
======================================
If you want to use the latest Suricata that needs rust, you will need to clone

  URI: https://github.com/meta-rust/meta-rust.git
  branch: master

  BBLAYERS += "/path/to/layer/meta-rust"

This will activate the dynamic-layer mechanism and pull in the newer suricata



Maintenance
======================================

Send pull requests, patches, comments or questions to yocto@lists.yoctoproject.org

When sending single patches, please using something like:
'git send-email -1 --to yocto@lists.yoctoproject.org --subject-prefix=meta-security][PATCH'

These values can be set as defaults for this repository:

$ git config sendemail.to yocto@lists.yoctoproject.org
$ git config format.subjectPrefix meta-security][PATCH

Now you can just do 'git send-email origin/master' to send all local patches.

For pull requests, please use create-pull-request and send-pull-request.
