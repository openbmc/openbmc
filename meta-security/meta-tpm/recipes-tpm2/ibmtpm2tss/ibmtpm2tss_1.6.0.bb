SUMMARY = "IBM's Software TPM 2.0 TSS"
DESCRIPTION = "This is a user space TSS for TPM 2.0. It implements the \
functionality equivalent to (but not API compatible with) the TCG TSS \
working group's ESAPI, SAPI, and TCTI API's (and perhaps more) but with a \
hopefully simpler interface. \
It comes with over 110 'TPM tools' samples that can be used for scripted \
apps, rapid prototyping, education, and debugging. \
It also comes with a web based TPM interface, suitable for a demo to an \
audience that is unfamiliar with TCG technology. It is also useful for \
basic TPM management."
