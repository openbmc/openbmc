# With this policy, all files on regular partitions are
# appraised. Files with signed IMA hash and normal hash are
# accepted. Signed files cannot be modified while hashed files can be
# (which will also update the hash). However, signed files can
# be deleted, so in practice it is still possible to replace them
# with a modified version.
#
# Without EVM, this is obviously not very secure, so this policy is
# just an example and/or basis for further improvements. For that
# purpose, some comments show what could be added to make the policy
# more secure.
#
# With EVM the situation might be different because access
# to the EVM key can be restricted.
#
# Files which are appraised are also measured. This allows
# debugging whether a file is in policy by looking at
# /sys/kernel/security/ima/ascii_runtime_measurements
