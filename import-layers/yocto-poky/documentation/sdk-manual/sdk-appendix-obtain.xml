    <title>Locating Pre-Built SDK Installers</title>

    <para>
        You can use existing, pre-built toolchains by locating and running
        an SDK installer script that ships with the Yocto Project.
        Using this method, you select and download an architecture-specific
        SDK installer and then run the script to hand-install the
        toolchain.
    </para>

    <para>
        You can find SDK installers here:
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem><para><emphasis>Standard SDK Installers:</emphasis>
                Go to <ulink url='&YOCTO_TOOLCHAIN_DL_URL;'></ulink>
                and find the folder that matches your host development system
                (i.e. <filename>i686</filename> for 32-bit machines or
                <filename>x86_64</filename> for 64-bit machines).</para>

                <para>Go into that folder and download the SDK installer
                whose name includes the appropriate target architecture.
                The toolchains provided by the Yocto Project are based off of
                the <filename>core-image-sato</filename> image and contain
                libraries appropriate for developing against that image.
                For example, if your host development system is a 64-bit x86
                system and you are going to use your cross-toolchain for a
                32-bit x86 target, go into the <filename>x86_64</filename>
                folder and download the following installer:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     poky-glibc-x86_64-core-image-sato-i586-toolchain-&DISTRO;.sh
                </literallayout>
                </para></listitem>
            <listitem><para><emphasis>Extensible SDK Installers:</emphasis>
                Installers for the extensible SDK are also located in
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_TOOLCHAIN_DL_URL;'></ulink>.
                These installers have the string
                <filename>ext</filename> as part of their names:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     poky-glibc-x86_64-core-image-sato-core2-64-toolchain-ext-&DISTRO;.sh
                </literallayout>
                </para></listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
    </para>

<section id='sdk-building-an-sdk-installer'>
    <title>Building an SDK Installer</title>

    <para>
        As an alternative to locating and downloading a SDK installer,
        you can build the SDK installer assuming you have first sourced
        the environment setup script.
        See the
        "<ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_QS_URL;#qs-building-images'>Building Images</ulink>"
        section in the Yocto Project Quick Start for steps that show you
        how to set up the Yocto Project environment.
        In particular, you need to be sure the
        <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-MACHINE'><filename>MACHINE</filename></ulink>
        variable matches the architecture for which you are building and that
        the
        <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-SDKMACHINE'><filename>SDKMACHINE</filename></ulink>
        variable is correctly set if you are building a toolchain designed to
        run on an architecture that differs from your current development host
        machine (i.e. the build machine).
    </para>

    <para>
        To build the SDK installer for a standard SDK and populate
        the SDK image, use the following command:
        <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ bitbake <replaceable>image</replaceable> -c populate_sdk
        </literallayout>
        You can do the same for the extensible SDK using this command:
        <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ bitbake <replaceable>image</replaceable> -c populate_sdk_ext
        </literallayout>
        These commands result in a SDK installer that contains the sysroot
        that matches your target root filesystem.
    </para>

    <para>
        When the <filename>bitbake</filename> command completes, the SDK
        installer will be in
        <filename>tmp/deploy/sdk</filename> in the Build Directory.

            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem><para>
                    By default, this toolchain does not build static binaries.
                    If you want to use the toolchain to build these types of
                    libraries, you need to be sure your image has the
                    appropriate static development libraries.
                    Use the
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-IMAGE_INSTALL'><filename>IMAGE_INSTALL</filename></ulink>
                    variable inside your <filename>local.conf</filename> file
                    to install the appropriate library packages.
                    Following is an example using <filename>glibc</filename>
                    static development libraries:
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " glibc-staticdev"
                    </literallayout>
                    </para></listitem>
                <listitem><para>
                    For additional information on building the installer,

<section id='sdk-extracting-the-root-filesystem'>
    <title>Extracting the Root Filesystem</title>

    <para>
        After installing the toolchain, for some use cases you
        might need to separately extract a root filesystem:
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem><para>You want to boot the image using NFS.
                </para></listitem>
            <listitem><para>You want to use the root filesystem as the
                target sysroot.
                For example, the Eclipse IDE environment with the Eclipse
                Yocto Plug-in installed allows you to use QEMU to boot
                under NFS.</para></listitem>
            <listitem><para>You want to develop your target application
                using the root filesystem as the target sysroot.
                </para></listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
    </para>

    <para>
        To extract the root filesystem, first <filename>source</filename>
        the cross-development environment setup script to establish
        necessary environment variables.
        If you built the toolchain in the Build Directory, you will find
        the toolchain environment script in the
        <filename>tmp</filename> directory.
        If you installed the toolchain by hand, the environment setup
        script is located in <filename>/opt/poky/&DISTRO;</filename>.
    </para>

    <para>
        After sourcing the environment script, use the
        <filename>runqemu-extract-sdk</filename> command and provide the
        filesystem image.
    </para>

    <para>
        Following is an example.
        The second command sets up the environment.
        In this case, the setup script is located in the
        <filename>/opt/poky/&DISTRO;</filename> directory.
        The third command extracts the root filesystem from a previously
        built filesystem that is located in the
        <filename>~/Downloads</filename> directory.
        Furthermore, this command extracts the root filesystem into the
        <filename>qemux86-sato</filename> directory:
        <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ cd ~
     $ source /opt/poky/&DISTRO;/environment-setup-i586-poky-linux
     $ runqemu-extract-sdk \
        ~/Downloads/core-image-sato-sdk-qemux86-2011091411831.rootfs.tar.bz2 \
        $HOME/qemux86-sato
        </literallayout>
        You could now point to the target sysroot at
        <filename>qemux86-sato</filename>.
    </para>

<section id='sdk-installed-standard-sdk-directory-structure'>
    <title>Installed Standard SDK Directory Structure</title>

    <para>
        The following figure shows the resulting directory structure after
        you install the Standard SDK by running the <filename>*.sh</filename>
        SDK installation script:
    </para>

    <para>
        <imagedata fileref="figures/sdk-installed-standard-sdk-directory.png" scale="60" align="center" />
    </para>

    <para>
        The installed SDK consists of an environment setup script for the SDK,
        a configuration file for the target, a version file for the target,
        and the root filesystem (<filename>sysroots</filename>) needed to
        develop objects for the target system.
    </para>

    <para>
        Within the figure, italicized text is used to indicate replaceable
        portions of the file or directory name.
        For example,
        <replaceable>install_dir</replaceable>/<replaceable>version</replaceable>
        is the directory where the SDK is installed.
        By default, this directory is <filename>/opt/poky/</filename>.
        And, <replaceable>version</replaceable> represents the specific
        snapshot of the SDK (e.g. <filename>&DISTRO;</filename>).
        Furthermore, <replaceable>target</replaceable> represents the target
        architecture (e.g. <filename>i586</filename>) and
        <replaceable>host</replaceable> represents the development system's
        architecture (e.g. <filename>x86_64</filename>).
        Thus, the complete names of the two directories within the
        <filename>sysroots</filename> could be
        <filename>i586-poky-linux</filename> and
        <filename>x86_64-pokysdk-linux</filename> for the target and host,
        respectively.
    </para>
</section>

<section id='sdk-installed-extensible-sdk-directory-structure'>
    <title>Installed Extensible SDK Directory Structure</title>

    <para>
        The following figure shows the resulting directory structure after
        you install the Extensible SDK by running the <filename>*.sh</filename>
        SDK installation script:
    </para>

    <para>
        <imagedata fileref="figures/sdk-installed-extensible-sdk-directory.png" scale="60" align="center" />
    </para>

    <para>
        The installed directory structure for the extensible SDK is quite
        different than the installed structure for the standard SDK.
        The extensible SDK does not separate host and target parts in the
        same manner as does the standard SDK.
        The extensible SDK uses an embedded copy of the OpenEmbedded
        build system, which has its own sysroots.
    </para>

    <para>
        Of note in the directory structure are an environment setup script
        for the SDK, a configuration file for the target, a version file for
        the target, and a log file for the OpenEmbedded build system
        preparation script run by the installer.
    </para>

    <para>
        Within the figure, italicized text is used to indicate replaceable
        portions of the file or directory name.
        For example,
        <replaceable>install_dir</replaceable> is the directory where the SDK
        is installed, which is <filename>poky_sdk</filename> by default.
        <replaceable>target</replaceable> represents the target
        architecture (e.g. <filename>i586</filename>) and
        <replaceable>host</replaceable> represents the development system's
        architecture (e.g. <filename>x86_64</filename>).
