    <title>The Application Development Toolkit (ADT)</title>

    <para>
        Part of the Yocto Project development solution is an Application Development
        Toolkit (ADT).
        The ADT provides you with a custom-built, cross-development
        platform suited for developing a user-targeted product application.
    </para>

    <para>
        Fundamentally, the ADT consists of the following:
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem><para>An architecture-specific cross-toolchain and matching
                sysroot both built by the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_DEV_URL;#build-system-term'>OpenEmbedded build system</ulink>.
                The toolchain and sysroot are based on a
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_DEV_URL;#metadata'>Metadata</ulink>
                configuration and extensions,
                which allows you to cross-develop on the host machine for the target hardware.
                </para></listitem>
            <listitem><para>The Eclipse IDE Yocto Plug-in.</para></listitem>
            <listitem><para>The Quick EMUlator (QEMU), which lets you simulate target hardware.
                </para></listitem>
            <listitem><para>Various user-space tools that greatly enhance your application
                development experience.</para></listitem>

    </para>

    <section id='the-cross-development-toolchain'>
        <title>The Cross-Development Toolchain</title>

        <para>
            The
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_DEV_URL;#cross-development-toolchain'>Cross-Development Toolchain</ulink>
            consists of a cross-compiler, cross-linker, and cross-debugger
            that are used to develop user-space applications for targeted
            hardware.
            This toolchain is created either by running the ADT Installer
            script, a toolchain installer script, or through a
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_DEV_URL;#build-directory'>Build Directory</ulink>
            that is based on your Metadata configuration or extension for
            your targeted device.
            The cross-toolchain works with a matching target sysroot.
        </para>
    </section>

    <section id='sysroot'>
        <title>Sysroot</title>

        <para>
            The matching target sysroot contains needed headers and libraries for generating
            binaries that run on the target architecture.
            The sysroot is based on the target root filesystem image that is built by
            the OpenEmbedded build system and uses the same Metadata configuration
            used to build the cross-toolchain.
        </para>

    <section id='eclipse-overview'>
        <title>Eclipse Yocto Plug-in</title>

        <para>
            The Eclipse IDE is a popular development environment and it fully supports
            development using the Yocto Project.
            When you install and configure the Eclipse Yocto Project Plug-in into
            the Eclipse IDE, you maximize your Yocto Project experience.
            Installing and configuring the Plug-in results in an environment that
            has extensions specifically designed to let you more easily develop software.
            These extensions allow for cross-compilation, deployment, and execution of
            your output into a QEMU emulation session.
            You can also perform cross-debugging and profiling.
            The environment also supports a suite of tools that allows you to perform
            remote profiling, tracing, collection of power data, collection of
            latency data, and collection of performance data.
        </para>

        <title>The QEMU Emulator</title>

        <para>
            The QEMU emulator allows you to simulate your hardware while running your
