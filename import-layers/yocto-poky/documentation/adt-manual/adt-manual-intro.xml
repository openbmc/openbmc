<title>Introduction</title>

    <para>
        Welcome to the Yocto Project Application Developer's Guide.
        This manual provides information that lets you begin developing applications
        using the Yocto Project.

    <para>
        The Yocto Project provides an application development environment based on
        an Application Development Toolkit (ADT) and the availability of stand-alone
        cross-development toolchains and other tools.
        This manual describes the ADT and how you can configure and install it,
        how to access and use the cross-development toolchains, how to
        customize the development packages installation,
        how to use command-line development for both Autotools-based and
        Makefile-based projects, and an introduction to the
        <trademark class='trade'>Eclipse</trademark> IDE Yocto Plug-in.
        <note>
            The ADT is distribution-neutral and does not require the Yocto
            Project reference distribution, which is called Poky.
            This manual, however, uses examples that use the Poky distribution.
