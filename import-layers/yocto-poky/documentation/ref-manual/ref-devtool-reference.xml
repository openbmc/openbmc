    <title><filename>devtool</filename> Quick Reference</title>

    <para>
        The <filename>devtool</filename> command-line tool provides a number
        of features that help you build, test, and package software.
        This command is available alongside the <filename>bitbake</filename>
        command.
        Additionally, the <filename>devtool</filename> command is a key
        part of the extensible SDK.
    </para>

    <para>
        This chapter provides a Quick Reference for the
        <filename>devtool</filename> command.
        For more information on how to apply the command when using the
        extensible SDK, see the
        "<ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_SDK_URL;#sdk-extensible'>Using the Extensible SDK</ulink>"
        section in the Yocto Project Software Development Kit (SDK) Developer's

            The <filename>devtool</filename> command line is organized
            similarly to Git in that it has a number of sub-commands for
            each function.
            You can run <filename>devtool --help</filename> to see all
            the commands:

            in which to accomplish builds.
            This layer is not specific to any single
            <filename>devtool</filename> command but is rather a common
            working area used across the tool.

     attic - A directory created if devtool believes it preserve
             anything when you run "devtool reset".  For example, if you
             run "devtool add", make changes to the recipe, and then
             run "devtool reset", devtool takes notice that the file has
             been changed and moves it into the attic should you still
             want the recipe.

     README - Provides information on what is in workspace layer and how to
              manage it.

     .devtool_md5 - A checksum file used by devtool.

     appends - A directory that contains *.bbappend files, which point to
               external source.

     conf - A configuration directory that contains the layer.conf file.

     recipes - A directory containing recipes.  This directory contains a
               folder for each directory added whose name matches that of the
               added recipe.  devtool places the <replaceable>recipe</replaceable>.bb file
               within that sub-directory.

     sources - A directory containing a working copy of the source files used
               when building the recipe.  This is the default directory used
               as the location of the source tree when you do not provide a
               source tree path.  This directory contains a folder for each
               set of source files matched to a corresponding recipe.

            to the workspace layer.
            The recipe you add should not exist -
            <filename>devtool</filename> creates it for you.
            The source files the recipe uses should exist in an external

            Use the <filename>devtool extract</filename> command to
            extract the source for an existing recipe.
            When you use this command, you must supply the root name
            of the recipe (i.e. no version, paths, or extensions), and
            you must supply the directory to which you want the source

            existing recipe.
            When you use this command, you must supply the root name

        <title>Modifying an Existing Recipe</title>

        <para>
            Use the <filename>devtool modify</filename> command to begin
            modifying the source of an existing recipe.
            This command is very similar to the
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_DEV_URL;#devtool-adding-a-new-recipe-to-the-workspace'><filename>add</filename></ulink>
            command except that it does not physically create the
            recipe in the workspace layer because the recipe already
            exists in an another layer.
        </para>

        <para>
            The <filename>devtool modify</filename> command extracts the
            source for a recipe, sets it up as a Git repository if the
            source had not already been fetched from Git, checks out a
            branch for development, and applies any patches from the recipe
            as commits on top.
            You can use the following command to checkout the source
            files:
            <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ devtool modify <replaceable>recipe</replaceable>
            </literallayout>
            Using the above command form, <filename>devtool</filename> uses
            the existing recipe's
            <link linkend='var-SRC_URI'><filename>SRC_URI</filename></link>
            statement to locate the upstream source, extracts the source
            into the default sources location in the workspace.
            The default development branch used is "devtool".
        </para>
    </section>

    <section id='devtool-edit-an-existing-recipe'>
        <title>Edit an Existing Recipe</title>

        <para>
            Use the <filename>devtool edit-recipe</filename> command
            to run the default editor, which is identified using the
            <filename>EDITOR</filename> variable, on the specified recipe.
        </para>

        <para>
            When you use the <filename>devtool edit-recipe</filename>
            command, you must supply the root name of the recipe
            (i.e. no version, paths, or extensions).
            Also, the recipe file itself must reside in the workspace
            as a result of the <filename>devtool add</filename> or
            <filename>devtool upgrade</filename> commands.
            However, you can override that requirement by using the
            "-a" or "--any-recipe" option.
            Using either of these options allows you to edit any recipe
            regardless of its location.
        </para>
    </section>

    <section id='devtool-updating-a-recipe'>
        <title>Updating a Recipe</title>

        <para>
            Use the <filename>devtool update-recipe</filename> command to
            update your recipe with patches that reflect changes you make
            to the source files.
            For example, if you know you are going to work on some
            code, you could first use the
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_DEV_URL;#devtool-modifying-a-recipe'><filename>devtool modify</filename></ulink>
            command to extract the code and set up the workspace.
            After which, you could modify, compile, and test the code.
        </para>

        <para>
            When you are satisfied with the results and you have committed
            your changes to the Git repository, you can then
            run the <filename>devtool update-recipe</filename> to create the
            patches and update the recipe:
            <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ devtool update-recipe <replaceable>recipe</replaceable>
            </literallayout>
            If you run the <filename>devtool update-recipe</filename>
            without committing your changes, the command ignores the
            changes.
        </para>

        <para>
            Often, you might want to apply customizations made to your
            software in your own layer rather than apply them to the
            original recipe.
            If so, you can use the
            <filename>-a</filename> or <filename>--append</filename>
            option with the <filename>devtool update-recipe</filename>
            command.
            These options allow you to specify the layer into which to
            write an append file:
            <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ devtool update-recipe <replaceable>recipe</replaceable> -a <replaceable>base-layer-directory</replaceable>
            </literallayout>
            The <filename>*.bbappend</filename> file is created at the
            appropriate path within the specified layer directory, which
            may or may not be in your <filename>bblayers.conf</filename>
            file.
            If an append file already exists, the command updates it
            appropriately.

        <title>Upgrading a Recipe</title>

        <para>
            Use the <filename>devtool upgrade</filename> command
            to upgrade an existing recipe to a new upstream version.
            The command puts the upgraded recipe file into the
            workspace along with any associated files, and extracts
            the source tree to a specified location should patches
            need rebased or added to as a result of the upgrade.
        </para>

        <para>
            When you use the <filename>devtool upgrade</filename> command,
            you must supply the root name of the recipe (i.e. no version,
            paths, or extensions), and you must supply the directory
            to which you want the source extracted.
            Additional command options let you control things such as
            the version number to which you want to upgrade (i.e. the

            <filename>.bbappend</filename> file) from the workspace layer.
            Realize that this command deletes the recipe and the
            append file.
            The command does not physically move them for you.
            Consequently, you must be sure to physically relocate your
            updated recipe and the append file outside of the workspace

            Use the <filename>devtool build</filename> command to cause the
            OpenEmbedded build system to build your recipe.
            The <filename>devtool build</filename> command is equivalent to
            <filename>bitbake -c populate_sysroot</filename>.
        </para>

        <para>
            When you use the <filename>devtool build</filename> command,
            you must supply the root name of the recipe (i.e. no version,
            paths, or extensions).
            You can use either the "-s" or the "--disable-parallel-make"
            option to disable parallel makes during the build.
            Here is an example:
            <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ devtool build <replaceable>recipe</replaceable>
            </literallayout>

        <title>Building Your Image</title>

        <para>
            Use the <filename>devtool build-image</filename> command
            to build an image, extending it to include packages from
            recipes in the workspace.
            Using this command is useful when you want an image that
            ready for immediate deployment onto a device for testing.
            For proper integration into a final image, you need to
            edit your custom image recipe appropriately.
        </para>

        <para>
            When you use the <filename>devtool build-image</filename>
            command, you must supply the name of the image.
            This command has no command line options:
            <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ devtool build-image <replaceable>image</replaceable>
            </literallayout>
        </para>

        <title>Deploying Your Software on the Target Machine</title>

        <para>
            Use the <filename>devtool deploy-target</filename> command to
            deploy the recipe's build output to the live target machine:
            <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ devtool deploy-target <replaceable>recipe</replaceable>&nbsp;<replaceable>target</replaceable>
            </literallayout>
            The <replaceable>target</replaceable> is the address of the
            target machine, which must be running an SSH server (i.e.
            <filename>user@hostname[:destdir]</filename>).
        </para>

        <para>
            This command deploys all files installed during the
            <link linkend='ref-tasks-install'><filename>do_install</filename></link>
            task.
            Furthermore, you do not need to have package management enabled
            within the target machine.
            If you do, the package manager is bypassed.

                    The <filename>deploy-target</filename>
                    functionality is for development only.
                    You should never use it to update an image that will be
                    used in production.

        <para>
            Use the <filename>devtool undeploy-target</filename> command to
            remove deployed build output from the target machine.
            For the <filename>devtool undeploy-target</filename> command to
            work, you must have previously used the
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_DEV_URL;#devtool-deploying-your-software-on-the-target-machine'><filename>devtool deploy-target</filename></ulink>
            command.
