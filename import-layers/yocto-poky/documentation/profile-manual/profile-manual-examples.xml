    <title>Slow Write Speed on Live Images</title>

    <para>
        In one of our previous releases (denzil), users noticed that booting
        off of a live image and writing to disk was noticeably slower.
        This included the boot itself, especially the first one, since first
        boots tend to do a significant amount of writing due to certain
        post-install scripts.
    </para>

    <para>
        The problem (and solution) was discovered by using the Yocto tracing
        tools, in this case 'perf stat', 'perf script', 'perf record'
        and 'perf report'.
    </para>
