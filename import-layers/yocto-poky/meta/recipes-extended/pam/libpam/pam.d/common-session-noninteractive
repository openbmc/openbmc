# /etc/pam.d/common-session-noninteractive - session-related modules
# common to all non-interactive services
#
# This file is included from other service-specific PAM config files,
# and should contain a list of modules that define tasks to be performed
# at the start and end of all non-interactive sessions.
#

# here are the per-package modules (the "Primary" block)
session	[default=1]			pam_permit.so
# here's the fallback if no module succeeds
session	requisite			pam_deny.so
# prime the stack with a positive return value if there isn't one already;
# this avoids us returning an error just because nothing sets a success code
# since the modules above will each just jump around
session	required			pam_permit.so
# and here are more per-package modules (the "Additional" block)
session	required	pam_unix.so
