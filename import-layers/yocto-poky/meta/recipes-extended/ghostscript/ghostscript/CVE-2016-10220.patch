Subject: [PATCH] fix crash with bad data supplied to makeimagedevice

Bug #697450 "Null pointer dereference in gx_device_finalize()"

The problem here is that the code to finalise a device unconditionally
frees the icc_struct member of the device structure. However this
particular (weird) device is not setup as a normal device, probably
because its very, very ancient. Its possible for the initialisation
of the device to abort with an error before calling gs_make_mem_device()
which is where the icc_struct member gets allocated (or set to NULL).

If that happens, then the cleanup code tries to free the device, which
calls finalize() which tries to free a garbage pointer.

Setting the device memory to 0x00 after we allocate it means that the
icc_struct member will be NULL< and our memory manager allows for that
happily enough, which avoids the problem.

Upstream-Status: Backport
CVE: CVE-2016-10220
