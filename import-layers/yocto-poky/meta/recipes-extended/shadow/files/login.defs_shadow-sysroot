# 022 is the default value, but 027, or even 077, could be considered
# better for privacy. There is no One True Answer here: each sysadmin

# Ignored if MD5_CRYPT_ENAB set to "yes".
#
#PASS_MAX_LEN		8

#
# Require password before chfn/chsh can make any changes.
#
#CHFN_AUTH		yes

#
# Which fields may be changed by regular users using chfn - use

# Password prompt (%s will be replaced by user name).
#
# XXX - it doesn't work correctly yet, for now leave it commented out
# to use the default which is just "Password: ".
#LOGIN_STRING		"%s's Password: "

#
# Only works if compiled with MD5_CRYPT defined:
# If set to "yes", new passwords will be encrypted using the MD5-based
# algorithm compatible with the one used by recent releases of FreeBSD.
# It supports passwords of unlimited length and longer salt strings.
# Set to "no" if you need to copy encrypted passwords to other systems
# which don't understand the new algorithm.  Default is "no".
#
# Note: If you use PAM, it is recommended to use a value consistent with
# the PAM modules configuration.
#
# This variable is deprecated. You should use ENCRYPT_METHOD.
#
#MD5_CRYPT_ENAB	no

#
# Only works if compiled with ENCRYPTMETHOD_SELECT defined:
# If set to MD5 , MD5-based algorithm will be used for encrypting password
# If set to SHA256, SHA256-based algorithm will be used for encrypting password
# If set to SHA512, SHA512-based algorithm will be used for encrypting password
# If set to DES, DES-based algorithm will be used for encrypting password (default)
# Overrides the MD5_CRYPT_ENAB option
#
# Note: If you use PAM, it is recommended to use a value consistent with
# the PAM modules configuration.
#
#ENCRYPT_METHOD DES

#
# Only works if ENCRYPT_METHOD is set to SHA256 or SHA512.
#
# Define the number of SHA rounds.
# With a lot of rounds, it is more difficult to brute forcing the password.
# But note also that it more CPU resources will be needed to authenticate
# users.
#
# If not specified, the libc will choose the default number of rounds (5000).
# The values must be inside the 1000-999999999 range.
# If only one of the MIN or MAX values is set, then this value will be used.
# If MIN > MAX, the highest value will be used.
#
# SHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS 5000
# SHA_CRYPT_MAX_ROUNDS 5000

#
# List of groups to add to the user's supplementary group set
# when logging in on the console (as determined by the CONSOLE
# setting).  Default is none.
#
# Use with caution - it is possible for users to gain permanent
# access to these groups, even when not logged in on the console.
# How to do it is left as an exercise for the reader...
#
#CONSOLE_GROUPS		floppy:audio:cdrom

#
# Should login be allowed if we can't cd to the home directory?
# Default in no.
#
DEFAULT_HOME	yes

# It should remove any at/cron/print jobs etc. owned by
# the user to be removed (passed as the first argument).
#
#USERDEL_CMD	/usr/sbin/userdel_local

#
# Enable setting of the umask group bits to be the same as owner bits
# (examples: 022 -> 002, 077 -> 007) for non-root users, if the uid is
# the same as gid, and username is the same as the primary group name.
#
# This also enables userdel to remove user groups if no members exist.
#
USERGROUPS_ENAB yes

#
# If set to a non-nul number, the shadow utilities will make sure that
# groups never have more than this number of users on one line.
# This permit to support split groups (groups split into multiple lines,
# with the same group ID, to avoid limitation of the line length in the
# group file).
#
# 0 is the default value and disables this feature.
#
#MAX_MEMBERS_PER_GROUP	0

#
# If useradd should create home directories for users by default (non
# system users only)
# This option is overridden with the -M or -m flags on the useradd command
# line.
#
CREATE_HOME     yes
