dhcp-client: fix invoke dhclient-script failed on Read-only file system

In read-only file system, '/etc' is on the readonly partition,
and '/etc/resolv.conf' is symlinked to a separate writable
partition.

In this situation, we should use shell variable to instead of
temp files '/etc/resolv.conf.dhclient' and '/etc/resolv.conf.dhclient6'.
