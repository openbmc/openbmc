Subject: [PATCH] elf/dl-deps.c: Make _dl_build_local_scope breadth first

According to the ELF specification:

When resolving symbolic references, the dynamic linker examines the symbol
tables with a breadth-first search.

This function was using a depth first search.  By doing so the conflict
resolution reported to the prelinker (when LD_TRACE_PRELINKING=1 is set)
was incorrect.  This caused problems when their were various circular
dependencies between libraries.  The problem usually manifested itself by
the wrong IFUNC being executed.

[BZ# 20488]

Upstream-Status: Submitted [libc-alpha]
