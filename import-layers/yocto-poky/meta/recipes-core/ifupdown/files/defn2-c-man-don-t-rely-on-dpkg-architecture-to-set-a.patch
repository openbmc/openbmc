Subject: [PATCH 1/2] defn2[c|man]: don't rely on dpkg-architecture to set arch

In yocto we'll always be cross compiling, and we'll always
be building on linux for linux (vs. *BSD, hurd, etc.)

Without this the arch is not detected, but it doesn't error
out, and hence you get useless binaries that don't know any
arch specific methods, and the end result will be strangeness
like the loopback device not being configured/enabled.
