# SYNOPSIS
#
#   CHECK_GNU_MAKE()
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   This macro searches for a GNU version of make. If a match is found, the
#   makefile variable `ifGNUmake' is set to the empty string, otherwise it
#   is set to "#". This is useful for including a special features in a
#   Makefile, which cannot be handled by other versions of make. The
#   variable _cv_gnu_make_command is set to the command to invoke GNU make
#   if it exists, the empty string otherwise.
#
#   Here is an example of its use:
#
#   Makefile.in might contain:
#
#       # A failsafe way of putting a dependency rule into a makefile
#       $(DEPEND):
#               $(CC) -MM $(srcdir)/*.c > $(DEPEND)
#
#       @ifGNUmake@ ifeq ($(DEPEND),$(wildcard $(DEPEND)))
#       @ifGNUmake@ include $(DEPEND)
#       @ifGNUmake@ endif
#
#   Then configure.in would normally contain:
#
#       CHECK_GNU_MAKE()
#       AC_OUTPUT(Makefile)
#
#   Then perhaps to cause gnu make to override any other make, we could do
#   something like this (note that GNU make always looks for GNUmakefile
#   first):
#
#       if  ! test x$_cv_gnu_make_command = x ; then
#               mv Makefile GNUmakefile
#               echo .DEFAULT: > Makefile ;
#               echo \  $_cv_gnu_make_command \$@ >> Makefile;
#       fi
#
#   Then, if any (well almost any) other make is called, and GNU make also
#   exists, then the other make wraps the GNU make.
