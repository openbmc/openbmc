Subject: [PATCH] Ignore DWARF sections.

Assume for now that we don't care about the DWARF sections due to path
differences. However, in the case the tool is ran on a "debug" package
it will most likely falsely say the packages have no differences.

Upstream-Status: Inappropriate [other]

The package difference tool is correctly labelling the packages as different
when the DWARF sections don't match due to paths. The paths in the debug info
should actually be made to be the same using compile flags or some other
mechanism.

However, to make the tool more useful to Yocto until the work can be done
to ensure identical paths in debug sections, this patch is being applied.
