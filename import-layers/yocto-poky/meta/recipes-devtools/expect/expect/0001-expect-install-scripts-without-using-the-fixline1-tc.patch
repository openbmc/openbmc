Upstream-Status: Inappropriate [wrlinux specific]

Subject: expect: install scripts without using the fixline1 tcl script

On older machines like SLED11.2, we are encountering do_install failures
complaining that 'GLIBC_2.14' is not found in /lib64/libc.so.6 but is required
by libtcl8.6.so.0.

This is because that we're executing the fixline1 tcl script which requires
libtcl8.6.so.0 in sysroot. However, all commands in SCRIPTS already have got
the correct first line, that is '#!/bin/sh'. We don't need to modify anything.
That's why we could just copy them.
