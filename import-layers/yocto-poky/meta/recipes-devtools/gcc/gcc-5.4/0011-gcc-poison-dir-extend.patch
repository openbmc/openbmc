Subject: [PATCH 11/46] gcc-poison-dir-extend

Add /sw/include and /opt/include based on the original
zecke-no-host-includes.patch patch.  The original patch checked for
/usr/include, /sw/include and /opt/include and then triggered a failure and
aborted.

Instead, we add the two missing items to the current scan.  If the user
wants this to be a failure, they can add "-Werror=poison-system-directories".
