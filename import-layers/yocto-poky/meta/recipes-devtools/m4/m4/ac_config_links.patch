Upstream-Status: Inappropriate [configuration]

This patch fixes a build problem for m4-native experienced on Ubuntu 9.10,
where autoconf/automake (AC_CONFIG_LINKS) ends up making GNUmakefile a
symlink to itself.

The patch comments out ac_config_links directly in configure,
as autoreconf is not actually run for m4-native.

I believe it should be safe, as GNUmakefile is actually unpacked from
source, and what we want is to is to not touch it.

Tested on x86_64_linux (Ubuntu 8.04 and 9.10).
