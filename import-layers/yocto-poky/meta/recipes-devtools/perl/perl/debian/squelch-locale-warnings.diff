Subject: Squelch locale warnings in Debian package maintainer scripts

Bug-Debian: http://bugs.debian.org/508764

The system locales are rather frequently out of sync with the C library
during package upgrades, causing a huge amount of useless Perl locale
warnings. Squelch them when running package maintainer scripts, detected
by the DPKG_RUNNING_VERSION environment variable.

Any real locale problem will show up after the system upgrade too, and
the warning will be triggered normally again at that point.
