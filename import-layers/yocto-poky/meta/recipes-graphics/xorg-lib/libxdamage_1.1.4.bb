SUMMARY = "Xdamage: X Damage extension library"

DESCRIPTION = "'Damage' is a term that describes changes make to pixel \
contents of windows and pixmaps.  Damage accumulates as drawing occurs \
in the drawable.  Each drawing operation 'damages' one or more \
rectangular areas within the drawable.  The rectangles are guaranteed to \
include the set of pixels modified by each operation, but may include \
significantly more than just those pixels.  The DAMAGE extension allows \
applications to either receive the raw rectangles as a stream of events, \
or to have them partially processed within the X server to reduce the \
amount of data transmitted as well as reduce the processing latency once \
the repaint operation has started."
