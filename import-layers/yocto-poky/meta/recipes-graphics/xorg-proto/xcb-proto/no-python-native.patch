Upstream uses AM_PATH_PYTHON to find a python binary and ask it where to install
libraries.  This means we either need to depend on python-native (large build
dependency, early in the build) or use the host python (pythondir reflects the
host and not the target, breaks builds).

The third option is to just hardcode the path where the module goes, as most
callers of the code use pkg-config to find where it was installed anyway.
