We really dont do static linking so its not going to cause issues for us but as such this is harming us by adding absolute
paths into -I options into fontconfig.pc which is them prepended with sysroot when read back by cross pkg-config and
we end up with -I <sysroot>/<sysroot>/usr/include/fontconfig in CFLAGS of clients which depend on it. one such example
is matchbox-panel-2 and it was working fine with gcc < 5 because it tolerated non-existing paths in -I flags but gcc-5
gently refuses and rightly so.
