# To use git with a proxy, you must use an external git proxy command, such as
# the one provided by scripts/oe-git-proxy. To use this script, copy it to
# your PATH and uncomment the following:
#GIT_PROXY_COMMAND ?= "oe-git-proxy"
#ALL_PROXY ?= "socks://socks.example.com:1080"
#or
#ALL_PROXY ?= "https://proxy.example.com:8080"
# If you wish to use certain hosts without the proxy, specify them in NO_PROXY.
# See the script for details on syntax.

# Uncomment this to use a shared download directory
#DL_DIR = "/some/shared/download/directory/"
