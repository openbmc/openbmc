        <title>BitBake Hello World</title>

        <para>
            The simplest example commonly used to demonstrate any new
            programming language or tool is the
            "<ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world_program">Hello World</ulink>"
            example.
            This appendix demonstrates, in tutorial form, Hello
            World within the context of BitBake.
            The tutorial describes how to create a new project
            and the applicable metadata files necessary to allow
            BitBake to build it.

            Once you have the source code on your machine, the BitBake directory

        <title>Setting Up the BitBake Environment</title>

        <para>
            First, you need to be sure that you can run BitBake.
            Set your working directory to where your local BitBake
            files are and run the following command:
            <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ ./bin/bitbake --version
     BitBake Build Tool Core version 1.23.0, bitbake version 1.23.0
            </literallayout>
            The console output tells you what version you are running.
        </para>

        <para>
            The recommended method to run BitBake is from a directory of your
            choice.
            To be able to run BitBake from any directory, you need to add the
            executable binary to your binary to your shell's environment
            <filename>PATH</filename> variable.
            First, look at your current <filename>PATH</filename> variable
            by entering the following:
            <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ echo $PATH
            </literallayout>
            Next, add the directory location for the BitBake binary to the
            <filename>PATH</filename>.
            Here is an example that adds the
            <filename>/home/scott-lenovo/bitbake/bin</filename> directory
            to the front of the <filename>PATH</filename> variable:
            <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ export PATH=/home/scott-lenovo/bitbake/bin:$PATH
            </literallayout>
            You should now be able to enter the <filename>bitbake</filename>
            command from the command line while working from any directory.

        <title>The Hello World Example</title>

        <para>
            The overall goal of this exercise is to build a
            complete "Hello World" example utilizing task and layer
            concepts.
            Because this is how modern projects such as OpenEmbedded and
            the Yocto Project utilize BitBake, the example
            provides an excellent starting point for understanding
            BitBake.
        </para>

        <para>
            To help you understand how to use BitBake to build targets,
            the example starts with nothing but the <filename>bitbake</filename>
            command, which causes BitBake to fail and report problems.
            The example progresses by adding pieces to the build to
            eventually conclude with a working, minimal "Hello World"
            example.
        </para>

        <para>
            While every attempt is made to explain what is happening during
            the example, the descriptions cannot cover everything.
            You can find further information throughout this manual.
            Also, you can actively participate in the
            <ulink url='http://lists.openembedded.org/mailman/listinfo/bitbake-devel'></ulink>
            discussion mailing list about the BitBake build tool.
        </para>

        <note>
            This example was inspired by and drew heavily from
            <ulink url="http://www.mail-archive.com/yocto@yoctoproject.org/msg09379.html">Mailing List post - The BitBake equivalent of "Hello, World!"</ulink>.
        </note>

        <para>
            As stated earlier, the goal of this example
            is to eventually compile "Hello World".
            However, it is unknown what BitBake needs and what you have
            to provide in order to achieve that goal.
            Recall that BitBake utilizes three types of metadata files:
            <link linkend='configuration-files'>Configuration Files</link>,
            <link linkend='classes'>Classes</link>, and
            <link linkend='recipes'>Recipes</link>.
            But where do they go?
            How does BitBake find them?
            BitBake's error messaging helps you answer these types of questions
            and helps you better understand exactly what is going on.
        </para>

        <para>
            Following is the complete "Hello World" example.
        </para>

        <orderedlist>
            <listitem><para><emphasis>Create a Project Directory:</emphasis>
                First, set up a directory for the "Hello World" project.
                Here is how you can do so in your home directory:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ mkdir ~/hello
     $ cd ~/hello
                </literallayout>
                This is the directory that BitBake will use to do all of
                its work.
                You can use this directory to keep all the metafiles needed
                by BitBake.
                Having a project directory is a good way to isolate your
                project.
                </para></listitem>
            <listitem><para><emphasis>Run Bitbake:</emphasis>
                At this point, you have nothing but a project directory.
                Run the <filename>bitbake</filename> command and see what
                it does:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ bitbake
     The BBPATH variable is not set and bitbake did not
     find a conf/bblayers.conf file in the expected location.
     Maybe you accidentally invoked bitbake from the wrong directory?
     DEBUG: Removed the following variables from the environment:
     GNOME_DESKTOP_SESSION_ID, XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP,

                The majority of this output is specific to environment variables
                that are not directly relevant to BitBake.
                However, the very first message regarding the
                <filename>BBPATH</filename> variable and the
                <filename>conf/bblayers.conf</filename> file
                is relevant.</para>
                <para>
                When you run BitBake, it begins looking for metadata files.
                The
                <link linkend='var-BBPATH'><filename>BBPATH</filename></link>
                variable is what tells BitBake where to look for those files.
                <filename>BBPATH</filename> is not set and you need to set it.
                Without <filename>BBPATH</filename>, Bitbake cannot
                find any configuration files (<filename>.conf</filename>)
                or recipe files (<filename>.bb</filename>) at all.
                BitBake also cannot find the <filename>bitbake.conf</filename>
                file.

            <listitem><para><emphasis>Setting <filename>BBPATH</filename>:</emphasis>
                For this example, you can set <filename>BBPATH</filename>
                in the same manner that you set <filename>PATH</filename>
                earlier in the appendix.
                You should realize, though, that it is much more flexible to set the
                <filename>BBPATH</filename> variable up in a configuration
                file for each project.</para>
                <para>From your shell, enter the following commands to set and

     $ BBPATH="<replaceable>projectdirectory</replaceable>"
     $ export BBPATH

                Use your actual project directory in the command.
                BitBake uses that directory to find the metadata it needs for
                your project.
                <note>
                    When specifying your project directory, do not use the
                    tilde ("~") character as BitBake does not expand that character
                    as the shell would.

                BitBake uses class files to provide common code and functionality.
                The minimally required class for BitBake is the
                <filename>classes/base.bbclass</filename> file.
                The <filename>base</filename> class is implicitly inherited by
                every recipe.
                BitBake looks for the class in the <filename>classes</filename>

                BitBake is finally reporting no errors.
                However, you can see that it really does not have anything
                to do.
                You need to create a recipe that gives BitBake something to do.

            <listitem><para><emphasis>Creating a Layer:</emphasis>
                While it is not really necessary for such a small example,
                it is good practice to create a layer in which to keep your
                code separate from the general metadata used by BitBake.
                Thus, this example creates and uses a layer called "mylayer".

                </para>
                <para>Minimally, you need a recipe file and a layer configuration
                file in your layer.
                The configuration file needs to be in the <filename>conf</filename>
                directory inside the layer.
                Use these commands to set up the layer and the <filename>conf</filename>
                directory:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ cd $HOME
     $ mkdir mylayer
     $ cd mylayer
     $ mkdir conf
                </literallayout>
                Move to the <filename>conf</filename> directory and create a
                <filename>layer.conf</filename> file that has the following:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     BBPATH .= ":${<link linkend='var-LAYERDIR'>LAYERDIR</link>}"

     <link linkend='var-BBFILES'>BBFILES</link> += "${LAYERDIR}/*.bb"

     <link linkend='var-BBFILE_COLLECTIONS'>BBFILE_COLLECTIONS</link> += "mylayer"
     <link linkend='var-BBFILE_PATTERN'>BBFILE_PATTERN_mylayer</link> := "^${LAYERDIR_RE}/"

                <para>You need to create the recipe file next.
                Inside your layer at the top-level, use an editor and create
                a recipe file named <filename>printhello.bb</filename> that
                has the following:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     <link linkend='var-DESCRIPTION'>DESCRIPTION</link> = "Prints Hello World"
     <link linkend='var-PN'>PN</link> = 'printhello'
     <link linkend='var-PV'>PV</link> = '1'

     python do_build() {
        bb.plain("********************");
        bb.plain("*                  *");
        bb.plain("*  Hello, World!   *");
        bb.plain("*                  *");
        bb.plain("********************");
     }
                </literallayout>
                The recipe file simply provides a description of the
                recipe, the name, version, and the <filename>do_build</filename>
                task, which prints out "Hello World" to the console.

                We have created the layer with the recipe and the layer
                configuration file but it still seems that BitBake cannot
                find the recipe.
                BitBake needs a <filename>conf/bblayers.conf</filename> that

                BitBake finds the <filename>printhello</filename> recipe and
                successfully runs the task.
                <note>
                    After the first execution, re-running
                    <filename>bitbake printhello</filename> again will not
                    result in a BitBake run that prints the same console
                    output.
                    The reason for this is that the first time the
                    <filename>printhello.bb</filename> recipe's
                    <filename>do_build</filename> task executes
                    successfully, BitBake writes a stamp file for the task.
                    Thus, the next time you attempt to run the task
                    using that same <filename>bitbake</filename> command,
                    BitBake notices the stamp and therefore determines
                    that the task does not need to be re-run.
                    If you delete the <filename>tmp</filename> directory
                    or run <filename>bitbake -c clean printhello</filename>
                    and then re-run the build, the "Hello, World!" message will
                    be printed again.
