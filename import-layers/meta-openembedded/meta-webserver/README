meta-webserver
==============

This layer provides support for building web servers, web-based
applications and related software.



Dependencies
------------

This layer depends on:

URI: git://github.com/openembedded/oe-core.git
subdirectory: meta
branch: krogoth 
revision: HEAD

For some recipes, the meta-oe layer is required:

URI: git://github.com/openembedded/meta-oe.git
subdirectory: meta-oe
branch: krogoth 
revision: HEAD



Layout
------

recipes-httpd/      Web servers
recipes-php/        PHP applications
recipes-support/    Miscellaneous support recipes
recipes-webadmin/   Standalone web administration interfaces


Notes
-----

* This layer used to provide a modphp recipe that built mod_php, but
  this is now built as part of the php recipe in meta-oe. However, since
  apache2 is required to build mod_php, and apache2 recipe is in this
  layer and recipes in meta-oe can't depend on it, mod_php is not built
  by default. If you do wish to use mod_php, you need to add "apache2"
  to the PACKAGECONFIG value for the php recipe in order to enable it.
  See here for info on how to do that:

  http://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/current/ref-manual/ref-manual.html#var-PACKAGECONFIG
