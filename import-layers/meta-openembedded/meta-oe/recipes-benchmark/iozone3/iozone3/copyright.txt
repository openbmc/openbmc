Below is author reply to question about distributing iozone3 in
OpenEmbedded:

========================================================================

Marcin,

        Re-distribution is permitted as long as the copyright is
    maintained and the source code is not changed. I do not
    see a problem with your mods to enable fileop for Linux-arm,
    as these mods have been returned to the Iozone folks,
    and they have been accepted for inclusion in the next
    release :-)

Thank you for your contribution,
Don Capps
