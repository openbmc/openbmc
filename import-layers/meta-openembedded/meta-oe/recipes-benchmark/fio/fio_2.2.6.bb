SUMMARY = "Filesystem and hardware benchmark and stress tool"
DESCRIPTION = "fio is an I/O tool meant to be used both for benchmark and \
stress/hardware verification. It has support for a number of I/O engines, \
I/O priorities (for newer Linux kernels), rate I/O, forked or threaded jobs, \
and much more. It can work on block devices as well as files. fio accepts \
job descriptions in a simple-to-understand text format. Several example job \
files are included. fio displays all sorts of I/O performance information."
