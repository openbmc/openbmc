Both lmbench and util-linux-ng packages provide own /usr/bin/line binaries.
Even though the binaries name is the same, their functionality is different.
This patch renames lmbench's line binary as lm_line to avoid conflicts with
util-linux-ng.  script/config-run is also modified (patch) to call lm_line
instead of line.
