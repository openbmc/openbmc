SUMMARY = "Python WBEM Client and Provider Interface"
DESCRIPTION = "\
A Python library for making CIM (Common Information Model) operations over \
HTTP using the WBEM CIM-XML protocol. It is based on the idea that a good \
WBEM client should be easy to use and not necessarily require a large amount \
of programming knowledge. It is suitable for a large range of tasks from \
simply poking around to writing web and GUI applications. \
\
WBEM, or Web Based Enterprise Management is a manageability protocol, like \
SNMP, standardised by the Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF) available \
at http://www.dmtf.org/standards/wbem. \
\
It also provides a Python provider interface, and is the fastest and easiest \
way to write providers on the planet."
