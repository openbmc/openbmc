Subject: [PATCH 1/2] THRIFT-3828 In cmake avoid use of both quoted paths and
 SYSTEM with include_directories()

This allows us to avoid issues where there are no paths to be added to
the include path (include_directories() errors when given an empty
string).

Specifically, gcc-6 requires that libraries stop passing paths like
'/usr/include' (or they will get libstdc++ build errors), so these paths
will be empty more often in the future.
