SUMMARY = "Replacement syslog API"
DESCRIPTION = "The EventLog library aims to be a replacement of the \
              simple syslog() API provided on UNIX systems. The \
              major difference between EventLog and syslog is that \
              EventLog tries to add structure to messages. EventLog \
              provides an interface to build, format and output an \
              event record. The exact format and output method can \
              be customized by the administrator via a configuration \
              file. his package is the runtime part of the library. \
