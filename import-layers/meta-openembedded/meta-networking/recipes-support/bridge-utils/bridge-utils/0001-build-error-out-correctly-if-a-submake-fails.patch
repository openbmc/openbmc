Subject: [PATCH 1/5] build: error out correctly if a submake fails
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Due to use of a for loop, return status from submake was always
ignored.

In the context of build-systems like OE this causes them to not
detect any errors and continue happily, resulting in a successful,
but incomplete, build.

Fix by having a nicer Makefile.in which now has rules for the
individual targets (directories) so that make itself can
figure out all the dependencies and build those targets as
needed rather than using a for loop to iterate over the
directories in a shell and thus loosing the return status of
the command inside the loop.

This has the added advantage that parallel builds work now.
