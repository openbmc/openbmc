Set the timeout to 0 since we don't want pppoe to try reconnecting,
we want whatever is calling it to reconnect. Lots of odd things
happen when you have pppoe retrying itself.

The path for the plugin is wrong, it's now part of ppp and is in a
ppp's plugin lib directory. If no path is specified then that's where
ppp looks, so that's what we do here.
