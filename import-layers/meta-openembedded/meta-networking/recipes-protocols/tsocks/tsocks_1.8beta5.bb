SUMMARY = "Libraries and wrapper for using a SOCKS proxy"
DESCRIPTION = "The role of tsocks is to allow non SOCKS aware \
applications (e.g telnet, ssh, ftp etc) to use SOCKS without any \
modification. It does this by intercepting the calls that applications \
make to establish network connections and negotating them through a \
SOCKS server as necessary."
