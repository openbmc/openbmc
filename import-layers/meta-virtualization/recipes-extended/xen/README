configuring the hypervisor
--------------------------

Since 4.7.0 Xen supports using Kconfig to configure the hypervisor. Similarly
to how the recipe for busybox works, you can provide a .config as a defconfig
to override the default configuration of the hypervisor. The easiest way
for you to take advantage of this is to create a .config for Xen and then
copy it to your Yocto layer as 'defconfig' inside of
'recipes-extended/xen/files/' and then create a bbappend adding
'file://defconfig' to your SRC_URI.

security patches
----------------

The base recipe does not include security fixes that the Xen community releases
as XSAs (http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/). The easiest way to include those is to
drop patches in 'recipes-extened/xen/files' and create a bbappend adding those
patches to SRC_URI and they will be applied. Alternatively, you can override
the SRC_URI to a git repo you provide that contains the patches.
