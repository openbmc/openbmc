# When system only use single PSU ( ex : PSU1 ) to power ON normal 12V,
# HSC2 will be trigged Fault event (FET health).
# At this time, to plug-in PSU2 in system, PSU2 won't deliver power to
# +12V_MB because HSC2 is protected by Fault event.
# Due to HSC2 protected, the PSU redundancy mechanism can't be created.
# Once PSU1 is plugged out at this moment, system will crash ( reset )
# because +12V_MB dropped.

# BMC SW work-around solution:
# - When BMC detect event PSU is plugged in system, BMC will reset HSC
# by disbale HOT SWAP and then enable HOT SWAP through pmbus command to clear
# Fault event.

# Note:
# In case hot swap occurs during BMC reset, BMC still not in operation state,
# BMC can't detect PSU plug/unplug, then the work-around won't be executed
