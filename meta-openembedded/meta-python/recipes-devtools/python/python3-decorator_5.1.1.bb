SUMMARY = "Python decorator utilities"
DESCRIPTION = "\
The aim of the decorator module it to simplify the usage of decorators \
for the average programmer, and to popularize decorators by showing \
various non-trivial examples. Of course, as all techniques, decorators \
can be abused and you should not try to solve every problem with a \
decorator, just because you can."
