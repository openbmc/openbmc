SUMMARY = "asyncio-compatible timeout context manager"
DESCRIPTION = "\
The context manager is useful in cases when you want to apply \
timeout logic around block of code or in cases when asyncio.wait_for() \
is not suitable. Also it's much faster than asyncio.wait_for() because \
timeout doesn't create a new task."
