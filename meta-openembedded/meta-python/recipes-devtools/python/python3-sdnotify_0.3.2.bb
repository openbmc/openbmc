SUMMARY = "A pure Python implementation of systemd's service notification protocol (sd_notify)"

DESCRIPTION = "\
  sdnotify is a pure Python implementation of the systemd sd_notify protocol. \
  This protocol can be used to inform systemd about service start-up completion, \
  watchdog events, and other service status changes. \
  Thus, this package can be used to write system services in Python that play nicely with systemd. \
