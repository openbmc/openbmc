bootstrap: check commands of openssl exist

It calls openssl commands dhparam and pkcs12 in script bootstrap. These
commands are configurable based on configure options 'no-dh' and
'no-des', and may not be provided by openssl. So check existence of
these commands. If not, abort running of script bootstrap.

2. https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/master/apps/build.info#L22

Upstream-Status: Denied [https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/pull/4059]
				 The maintainer commented in the pull that the script could
				 be run on a host which provides these openssl commands.
