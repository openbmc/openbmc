SUMMARY = "HTTP request/response parser for C"
DESCRIPTION = "This is a parser for HTTP messages written in C. It parses \
              both requests and responses. The parser is designed to be used \
              in performance HTTP applications. It does not make any \
              syscalls nor allocations, it does not buffer data, it can be \
              interrupted at anytime. Depending on your architecture, it \
              only requires about 40 bytes of data per message stream (in a \
              web server that is per connection)."
