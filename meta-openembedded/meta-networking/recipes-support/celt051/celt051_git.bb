SUMMARY = "The CELT codec is a compression algorithm for audio"
DESCRIPTION = "The CELT codec is a compression algorithm for \
audio. Like MP3, Vorbis, and AAC it is suitable for transmitting music \
with high quality. Unlike these formats CELT imposes very little delay \
on the signal, even less than is typical for speech centric formats \
like Speex, GSM, or G.729."
