Subject: [PATCH] unnecessary to check libpcap

since the check of libpcap did not consider the cross-compile, lead to the
below error:
	This autoconf log indicates errors, it looked at host include and/or
	library paths while determining system capabilities.

In fact, the libpcap has been added into the tcpdump's DEPENDS, not need to
check if libpcap existed.

Upstream-Status: Inappropriate [OE specific]
