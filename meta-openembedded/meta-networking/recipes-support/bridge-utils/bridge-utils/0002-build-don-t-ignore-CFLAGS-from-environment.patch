Subject: [PATCH] build: don't ignore CFLAGS from environment
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

We need to take them into account so as to behave nicely towards
build environments which expect to be able to set them, e.g. for
optimisation flags, or debug options.

Therefore they need to be added to the compiler command line of
every source file, and in addition, the same CFLAGS that were
used during compilation must also always be used during linking!
