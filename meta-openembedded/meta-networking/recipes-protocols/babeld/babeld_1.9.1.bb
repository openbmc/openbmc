SUMMARY = "Babel is a loop-avoiding distance-vector routing protocol"
DESCRIPTION = "\
Babel is a loop-avoiding distance-vector routing protocol for IPv6 and \
IPv4 with fast convergence properties. It is based on the ideas in DSDV, AODV \
and Cisco's EIGRP, but is designed to work well not only in wired networks \
but also in wireless mesh networks, and has been extended with support \
for overlay networks. Babel is in the process of becoming an IETF Standard. \
