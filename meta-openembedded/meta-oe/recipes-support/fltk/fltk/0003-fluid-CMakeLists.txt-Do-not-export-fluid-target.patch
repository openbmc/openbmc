Subject: [PATCH] fluid/CMakeLists.txt: Do not export fluid target
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

It does not work for us: The executable 'fluid' is not installed in
receipe-sysroot. So fltk cmake config contains an invalid reference.
Consumers of fltk using cmake will fail during configure for this invalid
reference with something like:

| CMake Error at <...>/recipe-sysroot/usr/share/fltk/FLTK-Targets.cmake:129 (message):
|   The imported target "fluid" references the file
| 
|      "<...>/recipe-sysroot/usr/bin/fluid"
| 
|   but this file does not exist.

Upstream-Status: Inappropriate [OE specific]
