Fix nss multilib build on openSUSE 11.x 32bit

While building lib64-nss on openSUSE 11.x 32bit, the nsinstall will
fail with error:

* nsinstall.c:1:0: sorry, unimplemented: 64-bit mode not compiled

It caused by the '-m64' option which passed to host gcc.

The nsinstall was built first while nss starting to build, it only runs
on host to install built files, it doesn't need any cross-compling or
multilib build options. Just clean the ARCHFLAG and LDFLAGS to fix this
error.
