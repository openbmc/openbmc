Send pull requests to openembedded-devel@lists.openembedded.org with '[meta-oe]' in the subject'

When sending single patches, please use something like:
'git send-email -M -1 --to openembedded-devel@lists.openembedded.org --subject-prefix=meta-oe][PATCH'

You are encouraged to fork the mirror on GitHub https://github.com/openembedded/openembedded-core
to share your patches, this is preferred for patch sets consisting of more than one patch.

Other services like gitorious, repo.or.cz or self-hosted setups are of course accepted as well,
'git fetch <remote>' works the same on all of them. We recommend GitHub because it is free, easy
to use, has been proven to be reliable and has a really good web GUI.
