Subject: [PATCH] jitter: jitter-config.in: avoit host poisoning while
 cross-compiling

When jitter is bundled into another project (poke), jitter-config --cppflags
return an unsafe path "-I /usr/include".

In the context of Buildroot, such configuration script woulf be "fixed"
after installation. But jitter-config is not installed by poke since it's
build as static library and liked to poke.

For now, patch jitter-config.in instead of jitter-config.in.m4sh since
there is an issue while converting the M4sh m4sh script ( .in.m4sh )
into a portable shell script ( .in ) ready to be processed by aclocal
for @-substitutions.
