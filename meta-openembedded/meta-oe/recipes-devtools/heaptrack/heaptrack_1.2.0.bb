SUMMARY = "Heap memory profiler for Linux"
DESCRIPTION = "Heaptrack traces all memory allocations and annotates these \
events with stack traces. Dedicated analysis tools then allow you to interpret \
the heap memory profile to find hotspots to reduce memory, leaks, allocation \
hotspots and temporary allocations"
