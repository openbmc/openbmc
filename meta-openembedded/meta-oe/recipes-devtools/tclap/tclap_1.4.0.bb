SUMMARY = "Templatized C++ Command Line Parser"
HOMEPAGE = "http://tclap.sourceforge.net/"
DESCRIPTION = "TCLAP is a small, flexible library that provides a simple interface \
for defining and accessing command line arguments. It was intially inspired by the \
user friendly CLAP libary. The difference is that this library is templatized, so \
the argument class is type independent. Type independence avoids identical-except-for-type \
objects, such as IntArg, FloatArg, and StringArg. While the library is not strictly \
compliant with the GNU or POSIX standards, it is close. \
