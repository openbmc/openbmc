SUMMARY = "Utility for IPMI control"
DESCRIPTION = "This package contains a utility for interfacing with devices that support \
the Intelligent Platform Management Interface specification. IPMI is \
an open standard for machine health, inventory, and remote power control. \
\
This utility can communicate with IPMI-enabled devices through either a \
kernel driver such as OpenIPMI or over the RMCP LAN protocol defined in \
the IPMI specification. IPMIv2 adds support for encrypted LAN \
communications and remote Serial-over-LAN functionality. \
\
It provides commands for reading the Sensor Data Repository (SDR) and \
displaying sensor values, displaying the contents of the System Event \
Log (SEL), printing Field Replaceable Unit (FRU) information, reading and \
setting LAN configuration, and chassis power control. \

#   FreeIPMI libraries, FreeIPMI has its own ipmitoool-like utility.
