Subject: [PATCH] thorvg: fix build with gcc-15

* add missing include to fix:
  src/libs/thorvg/thorvg.h:357:20: error: 'uint8_t' has not been declared
  357 |     Result opacity(uint8_t o) noexcept;
      |                    ^~~~~~~

* not needed with latest master where it was resolved differently in
  fc5c15638 feat(thorvg): use LVGL's malloc/realloc/zalloc/free (#7772)
  which includes stdlib/lv_string.h which includes misc/lv_types.h which
  includes stdint

Upstream-Status: Pending [not needed with latest master where it was resolved differently in fc5c15638 feat(thorvg): use LVGL's malloc/realloc/zalloc/free (#7772)]
