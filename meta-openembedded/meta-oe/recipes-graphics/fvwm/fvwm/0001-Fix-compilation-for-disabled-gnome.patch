Subject: [PATCH] Fix compilation for Helix.

Gnome support, including GNOME_INIT_HOOK, has been removed, but it was
still being called.

COMPAT_OLD_KEYSYMDEF is a check for a legacy system, which our system
most definitely is not.  It is accomplished by trying to execute
a program, which does not work when cross compiling.

Upstream-Status: Inappropriate [OE specific]
