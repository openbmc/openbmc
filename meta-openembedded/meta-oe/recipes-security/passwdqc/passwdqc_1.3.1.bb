SUMMARY = "A password/passphrase strength checking and enforcement toolset"
DESCRIPTION = "\
passwdqc is a password/passphrase strength checking and policy enforcement \
toolset, including an optional PAM module (pam_passwdqc), command-line \
programs (pwqcheck and pwqgen), and a library (libpasswdqc). \
pam_passwdqc is normally invoked on password changes by programs such as \
passwd(1).  It is capable of checking password or passphrase strength, \
enforcing a policy, and offering randomly-generated passphrases, with \
all of these features being optional and easily (re-)configurable. \
\
pwqcheck and pwqgen are standalone password/passphrase strength checking \
and random passphrase generator programs, respectively, which are usable \
from scripts. \
\
libpasswdqc is the underlying library, which may also be used from \
third-party programs. \
