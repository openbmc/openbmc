Subject: [PATCH 15/24] don't pass AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW flag to faccessat()

Avoid using AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW flag. It doesn't seem like the right
thing to do and it's not portable (not supported by musl). See:

  http://lists.landley.net/pipermail/toybox-landley.net/2014-September/003610.html
  http://www.openwall.com/lists/musl/2015/02/05/2

Note that laccess() is never passing AT_EACCESS so a lot of the
discussion in the links above doesn't apply. Note also that
(currently) all systemd callers of laccess() pass mode as F_OK, so
only check for existence of a file, not access permissions.
Therefore, in this case, the only distiction between faccessat()
with (flag == 0) and (flag == AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW) is the behaviour
for broken symlinks; laccess() on a broken symlink will succeed with
(flag == AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW) and fail (flag == 0).

The laccess() macros was added to systemd some time ago and it's not
clear if or why it needs to return success for broken symlinks. Maybe
just historical and not actually necessary or desired behaviour?

Upstream-Status: Inappropriate [musl specific]
