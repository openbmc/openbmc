+.TH RARP 8 "7 April 2000" "rarpd" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
+.SH NAME
+rarpd \- Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP) daemon
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.B "rarpd [-aAvde] [-b bootdir ] [ interface ]"
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.B Rarpd
+is a daemon which responds to RARP requests.
+RARP is used by some machines at boot time to discover their IP address.
+They provide their Ethernet address and
+.B rarpd
+responds with their IP address if it finds it in the ethers database
+(either
+.I /etc/ethers
+file or NIS+ lookup) and using DNS lookup if ethers database
+contains a hostname and not an IP address.
+By default
+.B rarpd
+also checks if a bootable image with a name starting with the IP address
+in hexadecimal uppercase letters is present in the TFTP boot directory
+(usually
+.I /tftpboot
+) before it decides to respond to the RARP request.
+.SH OPTIONS

+.TP
+.B \-e

+present, then even if the Ethernet address is present in
+the ethers database but the bootable image for the resolved IP does not exist,
+.B rarpd
+will not respond to the request.
+.TP
+.B "\-b bootdir"
+Use
+.I bootdir
+instead of the default
+.I /tftpboot
+as the TFTP boot directory for bootable image checks.
