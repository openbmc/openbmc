meta-gnome
===========

The recipe in this layer needs to have 'x11' in DISTRO_FEATURES 
to have effect. To enable them, add in configuration file the following line.

  DISTRO_FEATURES_append = " x11"

If meta-gnome is included, but x11 is not enabled as a
distro feature a warning is printed at parse time:

    You have included the meta-gnome layer, but
    'x11' has not been enabled in your DISTRO_FEATURES.

If you know what you are doing, this warning can be disabled by setting the following
variable in your configuration:

  SKIP_META_GNOME_SANITY_CHECK = 1
