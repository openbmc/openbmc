SUMMARY = "Text::WrapI18N - Line wrapping module with support for multibyte, \
fullwidth, and combining characters and languages without whitespaces \
between words."
DESCRIPTION = "This module intends to be a better Text::Wrap module. This module is \
needed to support multibyte character encodings such as UTF-8, EUC-JP, \
EUC-KR, GB2312, and Big5. This module also supports characters with \
irregular widths, such as combining characters (which occupy zero columns \
on terminal, like diacritical marks in UTF-8) and fullwidth characters \
(which occupy two columns on terminal, like most of east Asian \
characters). Also, minimal handling of languages which doesn't use \
whitespaces between words (like Chinese and Japanese) is supported."
