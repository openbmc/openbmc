SUMMARY = "Automatically give your module the ability to have plugins"
DESCRIPTION = "Provides a simple but, hopefully, extensible way of \
having 'plugins' for your module. Obviously this isn't going to be the \
be all and end all of solutions but it works for me.\
\
Essentially all it does is export a method into your namespace that \
looks through a search path for .pm files and turn those into class \
names.\
\
Optionally it instantiates those classes for you."
