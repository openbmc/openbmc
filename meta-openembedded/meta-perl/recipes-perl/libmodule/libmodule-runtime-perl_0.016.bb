SUMMARY = "Module::Runtime - runtime module handling"
DESCRIPTION = "The functions exported by this module deal with runtime \
handling of Perl modules, which are normally handled at compile time. This \
module avoids using any other modules, so that it can be used in low-level \
infrastructure. \
The parts of this module that work with module names apply the same syntax \
that is used for barewords in Perl source. In principle this syntax can vary \
between versions of Perl, and this module applies the syntax of the Perl on \
which it is running. In practice the usable syntax hasn't changed yet, but \
there's a good chance of it changing in Perl 5.18. \
The functions of this module whose purpose is to load modules include \
workarounds for three old Perl core bugs regarding require. These workarounds \
are applied on any Perl version where the bugs exist, except for a case where \
one of the bugs cannot be adequately worked around in pure Perl."
