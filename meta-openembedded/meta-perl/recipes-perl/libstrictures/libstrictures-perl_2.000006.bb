SUMMARY = "strictures - turn on strict and make all warnings fatal"
DESCRIPTION = "I've been writing the equivalent of this module at the top \
of my code for about a year now. I figured it was time to make it shorter. \
\
Things like the importer in \"use Moose\" don't help me because they turn \
warnings on but don't make them fatal -- which from my point of view is \
useless because I want an exception to tell me my code isn't warnings-clean. \
\
Any time I see a warning from my code, that indicates a mistake. \
\
Any time my code encounters a mistake, I want a crash -- not spew to STDERR \
and then unknown (and probably undesired) subsequent behaviour. \
\
I also want to ensure that obvious coding mistakes, like indirect object \
syntax (and not so obvious mistakes that cause things to accidentally compile \
as such) get caught, but not at the cost of an XS dependency and not at the \
cost of blowing things up on another machine. \
\
Therefore, \"strictures\" turns on additional checking, but only when it \
thinks it's running in a test file in a VCS checkout -- although if this \
causes undesired behaviour this can be overridden by setting the \
PERL_STRICTURES_EXTRA environment variable."
