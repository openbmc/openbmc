SUMMARY = "XML::SAX::Writer - SAX2 Writer"
DESCRIPTION = "\
XML::SAX::Writer helps to serialize SAX2 representations of XML documents to \
strings, files, and other flat representations. It handles charset encodings, \
XML escaping conventions, and so forth. It is still considered alpha, \
although it has been put to limited use in settings such as XML::LibXML and \
the AxKit XML Application Server. \
