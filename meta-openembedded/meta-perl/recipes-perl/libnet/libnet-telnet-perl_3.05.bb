SUMMARY = "Net-Telnet Perl module"
DESCRIPTION = "Net::Telnet allows you to make client connections to a TCP port and do \
network I/O, especially to a port using the TELNET protocol. Simple I/O \
methods such as print, get, and getline are provided. More sophisticated \
interactive features are provided because connecting to a TELNET port \
ultimately means communicating with a program designed for human interaction. \
These interactive features include the ability to specify a time-out and to \
wait for patterns to appear in the input stream, such as the prompt from a \
shell."
