# OpenBMC

[![Build Status](https://openpower.xyz/buildStatus/icon?job=openbmc-build)](https://openpower.xyz/job/openbmc-build/)

The OpenBMC project can be described as a Linux distribution for embedded
devices that have a BMC; typically, but not limited to, things like servers,
top of rack switches or RAID appliances. The OpenBMC stack uses technologies
such as [Yocto](https://www.yoctoproject.org/),
[OpenEmbedded](https://www.openembedded.org/wiki/Main_Page),
[systemd](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/), and
[D-Bus](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/) to allow easy
customization for your server platform.


## Setting up your OpenBMC project

### 1) Prerequisite
- Ubuntu 14.04

```
sudo apt-get install -y git build-essential libsdl1.2-dev texinfo gawk chrpath diffstat
```

- Fedora 28

```
sudo dnf install -y git patch diffstat texinfo chrpath SDL-devel bitbake \
    rpcgen perl-Thread-Queue perl-bignum perl-Crypt-OpenSSL-Bignum
sudo dnf groupinstall "C Development Tools and Libraries"
```
### 2) Download the source
```
git clone git@github.com:openbmc/openbmc.git
cd openbmc
```

### 3) Target your hardware
Any build requires an environment variable known as `TEMPLATECONF` to be set
to a hardware target.
You can see all of the known targets with
`find meta-* -name local.conf.sample`. Choose the hardware target and
then move to the next step. Additional examples can be found in the
[OpenBMC Cheatsheet](https://github.com/openbmc/docs/blob/master/cheatsheet.md)

Machine | TEMPLATECONF
--------|---------
Palmetto | ```meta-ibm/meta-palmetto/conf```
Zaius| ```meta-ingrasys/meta-zaius/conf```
Witherspoon| ```meta-ibm/meta-witherspoon/conf```
Romulus| ```meta-ibm/meta-romulus/conf```


As an example target Romulus
```
export TEMPLATECONF=meta-ibm/meta-romulus/conf
```

### 4) Build

```
. openbmc-env
bitbake obmc-phosphor-image
```

Additional details can be found in the [docs](https://github.com/openbmc/docs)
repository.

## OpenBMC Development

The OpenBMC community maintains a set of tutorials new users can go through
to get up to speed on OpenBMC development out
[here](https://github.com/openbmc/docs/blob/master/development/README.md)

## Build Validation and Testing
Commits submitted by members of the OpenBMC GitHub community are compiled and
tested via our [Jenkins](https://openpower.xyz/) server.  Commits are run
through two levels of testing.  At the repository level the makefile `make
check` directive is run.  At the system level, the commit is built into a
firmware image and run with an arm-softmmu QEMU model against a barrage of
[CI tests](https://openpower.xyz/job/openbmc-test-qemu-ci/).

Commits submitted by non-members do not automatically proceed through CI
testing. After visual inspection of the commit, a CI run can be manually
performed by the reviewer.

Automated testing against the QEMU model along with supported systems are
performed.  The OpenBMC project uses the
[Robot Framework](http://robotframework.org/) for all automation.  Our
complete test repository can be found
[here](https://github.com/openbmc/openbmc-test-automation).

## Submitting Patches
Support of additional hardware and software packages is always welcome.
Please follow the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/openbmc/docs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
when making a submission.  It is expected that contributions contain test
cases.

## Bug Reporting
[Issues](https://github.com/openbmc/openbmc/issues) are managed on
GitHub.  It is recommended you search through the issues before opening
a new one.
