# OpenBMC

[![Build Status](https://openpower.xyz/buildStatus/icon?job=openbmc-build)](https://openpower.xyz/job/openbmc-build/)

OpenBMC is a Linux distribution for management controllers used in devices such
as servers, top of rack switches or RAID appliances. It uses
[Yocto](https://www.yoctoproject.org/),
[OpenEmbedded](https://www.openembedded.org/wiki/Main_Page),
[systemd](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/), and
[D-Bus](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/) to allow easy
customization for your platform.

## Setting up your OpenBMC project

### 1) Prerequisite
- Ubuntu 14.04

```
sudo apt-get install -y git build-essential libsdl1.2-dev texinfo gawk chrpath diffstat \
    zstd pigz
```

- Fedora 28

```
sudo dnf install -y git patch diffstat texinfo chrpath SDL-devel bitbake \
    rpcgen perl-Thread-Queue perl-bignum perl-Crypt-OpenSSL-Bignum
sudo dnf groupinstall "C Development Tools and Libraries"
```
### 2) Download the source
```
git clone git@github.com:openbmc/openbmc.git
cd openbmc
```

### 3) Target your hardware
Any build requires an environment set up according to your hardware target.
There is a special script in the root of this repository that can be used
to configure the environment as needed. The script is called `setup` and
takes the name of your hardware target as an argument.

The script needs to be sourced while in the top directory of the OpenBMC
repository clone, and, if run without arguments, will display the list
of supported hardware targets, see the following example:

```
$ . setup <machine> [build_dir]
Target machine must be specified. Use one of:

bletchley               gsj                     romulus
dl360poc                kudo                    s2600wf
e3c246d4i               mihawk                  swift
ethanolx                mtjade                  tiogapass
evb-ast2500             nicole                  transformers
evb-ast2600             olympus-nuvoton         witherspoon
evb-npcm750             on5263m5                witherspoon-tacoma
f0b                     p10bmc                  x11spi
fp5280g2                palmetto                yosemitev2
g220a                   qemuarm                 zaius
gbs                     quanta-q71l
```

Once you know the target (e.g. romulus), source the `setup` script as follows:

```
. setup romulus
```

### 4) Build

```
bitbake obmc-phosphor-image
```

repository.

## OpenBMC Development

The OpenBMC community maintains a set of tutorials new users can go through
to get up to speed on OpenBMC development out
[here](https://github.com/openbmc/docs/blob/master/development/README.md)

## Build Validation and Testing
Commits submitted by members of the OpenBMC GitHub community are compiled and
tested via our [Jenkins](https://jenkins.openbmc.org/) server. Commits are run
through two levels of testing.  At the repository level the makefile `make
check` directive is run.  At the system level, the commit is built into a
firmware image and run with an arm-softmmu QEMU model against a barrage of
[CI tests](https://openpower.xyz/job/openbmc-test-qemu-ci/).

Commits submitted by non-members do not automatically proceed through CI
testing. After visual inspection of the commit, a CI run can be manually
performed by the reviewer.

Automated testing against the QEMU model along with supported systems are
performed.  The OpenBMC project uses the
[Robot Framework](http://robotframework.org/) for all automation.  Our
complete test repository can be found
[here](https://github.com/openbmc/openbmc-test-automation).

## Submitting Patches
Support of additional hardware and software packages is always welcome.
Please follow the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/openbmc/docs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
when making a submission.  It is expected that contributions contain test
cases.

## Bug Reporting
[Issues](https://github.com/openbmc/openbmc/issues) are managed on
GitHub.  It is recommended you search through the issues before opening
a new one.
