+Kernel driver ibm-cffps
+=======================
+
+Supported chips:
+  * IBM Common Form Factor power supply
+
+Author: Eddie James <eajames@us.ibm.com>
+
+Description
+-----------
+
+This driver supports IBM Common Form Factor (CFF) power supplies. This driver
+is a client to the core PMBus driver.
+
+Usage Notes
+-----------
+
+This driver does not auto-detect devices. You will have to instantiate the
+devices explicitly. Please see Documentation/i2c/instantiating-devices for
+details.
+
+Sysfs entries

+
+curr1_alarm		Output current over-current fault.
+curr1_input		Measured output current in mA.
+curr1_label		"iout1"
