# Chassis power synchronization targets
# - start-pre:         Services to run before we start power on process
# - start:             Services to run to do the chassis power on
# - on:                Services to run once power is on
# - stop-pre,stop,off: Same as above but applied to powering off
# - reset-on:          Services to check if chassis power is on after bmc reset

# Chassis action power targets
# - on:  Services to run to power on the chassis
# - off: Services to run to power off the chassis
# - reset: Services to check chassis power state and update chassis "on" target
# - hard-off: Services to force an immediate power off of the chassis

# Track all host synchronization point targets
# - start-pre:                 Services to run before we start host boot
# - starting:                  Services to run to do the host boot
# - started:                   Services to run once the host is booted
# - stop-pre,stopping,stopped: Same as above but applied to shutting down the host
# - reset-running:             Services to check if host is running after bmc reset

# Track all host action targets
# - start:    Service to run to start the host
# - stop:     Services to run to shutdown the host
# - quiesce:  Target to enter on host boot failure
# - shutdown: Tell host to shutdown, then stop system
# - reset:   Services to check if host is running and update host "start" target
# - crash:   Target to run when host crashes. it is very much similar to
#            quiesce target but the only delta is that this target contains
#            multiple services and one of them is the quiesce target.
# - timeout: Target to run when host watchdog times out
# - reboot:  Reboot the host
