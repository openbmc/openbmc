#
# /etc/pam.d/common-auth - authentication settings common to all services
#
# This file is included from other service-specific PAM config files,
# and should contain a list of the authentication modules that define
# the central authentication scheme for use on the system
# (e.g., /etc/shadow, LDAP, Kerberos, etc.).  The default is to use the
# traditional Unix authentication mechanisms.

# here are the per-package modules (the "Primary" block)
auth	[success=ok user_unknown=ignore default=2]	pam_tally2.so deny=0 unlock_time=0
# Try for local user first, and then try for ldap
auth	[success=2 default=ignore]	pam_unix.so quiet
-auth    [success=1 default=ignore]  	pam_ldap.so ignore_unknown_user ignore_authinfo_unavail
# here's the fallback if no module succeeds
auth	requisite			pam_deny.so
# prime the stack with a positive return value if there isn't one already;
# this avoids us returning an error just because nothing sets a success code
# since the modules above will each just jump around
auth	required			pam_permit.so
# and here are more per-package modules (the "Additional" block)
