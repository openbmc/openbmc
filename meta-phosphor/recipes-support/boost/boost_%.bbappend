#This is largely to improve our build times by not building or installing
#modules that OpenBMC does not use by our coding standard.  Another thing to
#note is that for most targets, coroutine and context libraries are also added
#with a BOOST_LIBS:append:<platform> for most targets.  Chrono/Thread should not
#be relied directly, but are required dependencies of context and coroutine.
#See the relevant portion of the openbmc coding standard with regards to boost
#libraries

BOOST_LIBS:openbmc-phosphor = "chrono thread context coroutine"
