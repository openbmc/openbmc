          Data:
              # The mailbox must be no smaller that 5 blocks. That is 80 bytes.
              # This array does NOT include the 3-byte IANA enterprise number.
              # So the minimum is 77 bytes. 512 bytes look enough to accomodate
              # all boot settings, yet not too big to waste space.
              # 512 - 3 = 509
