# /etc/pam.d/common-auth - authentication settings common to all services
#
# This file is included from other service-specific PAM config files,
# and should contain a list of the authentication modules that define
# the central authentication scheme for use on the system
# (e.g., /etc/shadow, LDAP, Kerberos, etc.).  The default is to use the
# traditional Unix authentication mechanisms.

# here are the per-package modules (the "Primary" block)
# Try for local user first, and then try for ldap
auth required pam_google_authenticator.so nullok

# Control gets here when no authentication module succeeds.  Increment the
# failure tally and return failure status to PAM.

# Control gets here when authentication succeeds.  Check if the user is locked
# out due to consecutive authentication failures and return status accordingly.
