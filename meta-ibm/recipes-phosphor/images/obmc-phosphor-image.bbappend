# Optionally configure IBM service accounts
#
# To configure your distro, add the following line to its config:
#     DISTRO_FEATURES += "ibm-service-account-policy"
#
# The service account policy is as follows:
#   root - The root account remains present.  It is needed for internal
#     accounting purposes and for debugging service access.
#   admin - Provides administrative control over the BMC.  The role is
#     SystemAdministrator.  Admin users have access to interfaces including:
#     Redfish, REST APIs, Web.  No access to the BMC via: the BMC's physical
#     console, SSH to the BMC's command line.
#     IPMI access is not granted by default, but admins can authorize
#     themselves and enable the IPMI service.
#     The admin has access to the host console: ssh -p2200 admin@${bmc}.
#     The admin account does not have a home directory.
#   service - Provides IBM service and support representatives (SSRs, formerly
#     known as customer engineers or CEs) access to the BMC.  The role is
#     OemIBMServiceAgent.  The service user has full admin access, plus access
#     to BMC interfaces intended only to service the BMC and host, including
#     SSH access to the BMC's command line.
#     The service account is not authorized to IPMI because of the inherent
#     security weakness in the IPMI spec and also because the IPMI
#     implementation was not enhanced to use the ACF support.
#     The service account does not have a home directory.  The home directory is
#     set to / (the root directory) to allow dropbear ssh connections.
