README for adm1278 hwmon driver
==================================
Yi Li <shliyi@cn.ibm.com>


This is a temporary kernel patch to enable hwmon driver for adm1278 chip on Barreleye.
When this patch is merged into linux kernel, this patch will be removed from openbmc.

The adm1278 driver is created according to datasheet:
http://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/ADM1278.pdf

The patch heavily re-used adm1278 enabling code from: https://github.com/facebook/openbmc/blob/master/meta-aspeed/recipes-kernel/linux/files/patch-2.6.28.9/0000-linux-openbmc.patch.

This patch has been tested on barreleye, by following these steps:

1) There are 3 adm1278 devices on Barreleye

I2C5: P12v_a for CPU0
I2C6: P12v_b for CPU1
I2C7: P12v_c for HDD and IO Board

2) adm1278 driver is based on adm1275.c, which depends on pmbus. This patch builds
adm1275 and pmbus into kernel.

3) When kernel booted, initialize the adm1278 devices:
We have add adm1278 to device tree, so do not need to do bellow steps.
(
root@barreleye:~# echo adm1278 0x10 > /sys/class/i2c-adapter/i2c-4/new_device
root@barreleye:~# echo adm1278 0x10 > /sys/class/i2c-adapter/i2c-5/new_device
root@barreleye:~# echo adm1278 0x10 > /sys/class/i2c-adapter/i2c-6/new_device
)

There will be three new hwmon sysfs entries created:

4) For details of what each hwmon sysfs attributes mean, please refer to:
https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/hwmon/pmbus
For short, 'curr1_*' refers to 'IOUT', 'in1_*' refers to 'vin', 'in2_*' refers to 'vout', 'power1_*' refers to 'input power',
'temp1_*' for 'temperature'.

5) Remaining issue:

5.1) Currently, i2c_aspeed driver does not handle "i2c_smbus_read_block_data()" correctly. So this patch has to bypass some detection code.
We need to fix this issue when the patch is merged to kernel.
5.2) According to adm1278 datasheet, there is a sense resistor used to measure power and current. The resistor will affect conversion between
adm1278 register value to real-world value for current and power. The default resistor value is 250 microohms.
When build the adm1275 driver as kernel module, we can set this resistor value by:

# insmod adm1275.ko r_sense=500

When the driver is built into kernel, in kernel boot option, add:

adm1275.r_sense=500

This will set the 'sense resistor' to 500 micro-ohms.
5.3) Some of the sensor value, e.g, 'temp1_input' seems not reasonable, e.g:

root@barreleye:~# cat /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon4/temp1_input
-270952

Need further check on that.

5.4) The adm1278 driver re-used sensor inteface of common pmbus driver. The adm1278 chip itself has more sensors, like 'READ_EIN'.
If we need those sensors, we need to add additional interface.
