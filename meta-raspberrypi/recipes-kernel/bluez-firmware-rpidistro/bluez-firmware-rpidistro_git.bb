RPi-Distro obtains these directly from Cypress; they are not submitted \
to linux-firmware for general use."

# Upstream has provided[^1] licensing information in the Debian
# copyright file.  The wording of the Cypress license subsequently
# changed in linux-firmware.
#
# Rather than make assumptions about what's supposed to be what, we'll
# use the license implied by the source of these files, named to avoid
# conflicts with linux-firmware.
