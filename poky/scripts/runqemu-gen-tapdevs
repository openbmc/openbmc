# Create a "bank" of tap network devices that can be used by the
# runqemu script. This script needs to be run as root, and will
# use the tunctl binary from the build system sysroot. Note: many Linux 
# distros these days still use an older version of tunctl which does not
# support the group permissions option, hence the need to use the build
# system provided version.
