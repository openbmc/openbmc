Subject: [PATCH] dropbear: new feature: disable-weak-ciphers

This feature disables all CBC, SHA1, and diffie-hellman group1 ciphers
in the dropbear ssh server and client since they're considered weak ciphers
and we want to support the stong algorithms.

Upstream-Status: Inappropriate [configuration]
