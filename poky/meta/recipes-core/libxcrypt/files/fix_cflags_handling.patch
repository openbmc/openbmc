Subject: [PATCH] libxcrypt: Update to 4.4.19 release and fix symbol version

If you pass CFLAGS with a leading space, " " gets passed to popen and convinces
gcc to try and open a file called " ". This results in a confusing error message
like:

x86_64-pokysdk-linux-gcc: error: : No such file or directory

Avoid this by stripping empty elements out of CFLAGS.
