Subject: [PATCH] busybox: fail on no media

Upstream-Status: Denied
[https://www.mail-archive.com/busybox@busybox.net/msg22354.html]

The current behaviour of busybox is to try all fstype when automounting
even when no media exists.  The util-linux mount command bails when no
media exists, so change the behaviour of busybox to do the same.

It could also be argued that the KERN_INFO message from btrfs could be
removed, but that would be harder to accomplish.
