SUMMARY  = "Embedded Linux Library"
HOMEPAGE = "https://01.org/ell"
DESCRIPTION = "The Embedded Linux Library (ELL) provides core, \
low-level functionality for system daemons. It typically has no \
dependencies other than the Linux kernel, C standard library, and \
libdl (for dynamic linking). While ELL is designed to be efficient \
and compact enough for use on embedded Linux platforms, it is not \
limited to resource-constrained systems."
