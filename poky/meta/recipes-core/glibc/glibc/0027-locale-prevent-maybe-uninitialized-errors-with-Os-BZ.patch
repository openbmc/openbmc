Subject: [PATCH] locale: prevent maybe-uninitialized errors with -Os [BZ
 #19444]

Fixes following error when building for aarch64 with -Os:
| In file included from strcoll_l.c:43:
| strcoll_l.c: In function '__strcoll_l':
| ../locale/weight.h:31:26: error: 'seq2.back_us' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]
|    int_fast32_t i = table[*(*cpp)++];
|                           ^~~~~~~~~
| strcoll_l.c:304:18: note: 'seq2.back_us' was declared here
|    coll_seq seq1, seq2;
|                   ^~~~
| In file included from strcoll_l.c:43:
| ../locale/weight.h:31:26: error: 'seq1.back_us' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]
|    int_fast32_t i = table[*(*cpp)++];
|                           ^~~~~~~~~
| strcoll_l.c:304:12: note: 'seq1.back_us' was declared here
|    coll_seq seq1, seq2;
|             ^~~~

        Partial fix for [BZ #19444]
