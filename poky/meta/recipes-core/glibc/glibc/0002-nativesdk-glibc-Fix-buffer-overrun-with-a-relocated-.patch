Subject: [PATCH 02/28] nativesdk-glibc: Fix buffer overrun with a relocated
 SDK

When ld-linux-*.so.2 is relocated to a path that is longer than the
original fixed location, the dynamic loader will crash in open_path
because it implicitly assumes that max_dirnamelen is a fixed size that
never changes.

The allocated buffer will not be large enough to contain the directory
path string which is larger than the fixed location provided at build
time.

Upstream-Status: Inappropriate [OE SDK specific]
