# OELAYOUT_ABI allows us to notify users when the format of TMPDIR changes in

# HASHEQUIV_HASH_VERSION is injected into the output hash calculation used by
# hashequiv. Changing this means previous hashes will no longer match, allowing
# a reset of the equivalence, for example when reproducibility issues break the
# existing match data. Distros can also append to this value for the same effect.
