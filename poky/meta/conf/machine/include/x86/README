Most of the items for the X86 architectures are defined in the single
arch-x86 file.

Three ABIs are define, m32, mx32 and m64.

The following is the list of X86 specific variables:

X86ARCH32 - This is the 32-bit architecture GNU canonical arch, TUNE_ARCH.

X86ARCH64 - This is the 64-bit architecture GNU canonical arch, TUNE_ARCH.

The TUNE_PKGARCH is defined as follows:

TUNE_PKGARCH = ${TUNE_PKGARCH:tune-${DEFAULTTUNE}}

The package architecture for 32-bit targets is historical and generally
set to to match the core compatible processor type, i.e. i386.

For 64-bit architectures, the architecture is expected to end in '_64'.

If the x32 ABI is used, then the _64 is further extended with a '_x32'.
