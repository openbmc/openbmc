# This file contains a list of CVE's where resolution has proven to be impractical
# or there is no reasonable action the Yocto Project can take to resolve the issue.
# It contains all the information we are aware of about an issue and analysis about
# why we believe it can't be fixed/handled. Additional information is welcome through
# patches to the file.
#
# Include this file in your local.conf or distro.conf to exclude these CVE's
# from the cve-check results or add to the bitbake command with:

#
# The file is not included by default since users should review this data to ensure

# We may also include "in-flight" information about current/ongoing CVE work with

#cargo security advisor https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/01/10/cve-2022-46176.html
#This CVE is a security issue when using cargo ssh. In kirkstone, rust 1.59.0 is used and the rust on-target is not supported, so the target images are not vulnerable to the cve.
#The bitbake using the 'wget' (which uses 'https') for fetching the sources instead of ssh. So, the cargo-native are also not vulnerable to this cve and so added to excluded list.

# epiphany https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2005-0238
# The issue here is spoofing of domain names using characters from other character sets.
# There has been much discussion amongst the epiphany and webkit developers and
# whilst there are improvements about how domains are handled and displayed to the user
# there is unlikely ever to be a single fix to webkit or epiphany which addresses this
# problem. Ignore this CVE as there isn't any mitigation or fix or way to progress this further
# we can seem to take.

# glibc https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2010-4756
# Issue is memory exhaustion via glob() calls, e.g. from within an ftp server
# Best discussion in https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=681681
# Upstream don't see it as a security issue, ftp servers shouldn't be passing

# db
# Since Oracle relicensed bdb, the open source community is slowly but surely replacing bdb with

# Kernel CVEs, e.g. linux-yocto*
#
# For OE-Core our policy is to stay as close to the kernel stable releases as we can. This should
# ensure the bulk of the major kernel CVEs are fixed and we don't dive into each individual issue
# as the stable maintainers are much more able to do that.
#
# Rather than just ignore all kernel CVEs, list the ones we ignore on this basis here, allowing new
# issues to be visible. If anyone wishes to clean up CPE entries with NIST for these, we'd
# welcome than and then entries can likely be removed from here.
