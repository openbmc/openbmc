+`LL_CC' combination.  Here `LL' is an ISO 639 two-letter language code,
+and `CC' is an ISO 3166 two-letter country code.  For example, let's
+suppose that you speak German and live in Germany.  At the shell
+prompt, merely execute `setenv LANG de_DE' (in `csh'),

-   An operating system might already offer message localization for
-many of its programs, while other programs have been installed locally
-with the full capabilities of GNU `gettext'.  Just using `gettext'
-extended syntax for `LANG' would break proper localization of already
-available operating system programs.  In this case, users should set
-both `LANGUAGE' and `LANG' variables in their environment, as programs
-using GNU `gettext' give preference to `LANGUAGE'.  For example, some
-Swedish users would rather read translations in German than English for
-when Swedish is not available.  This is easily accomplished by setting
-`LANGUAGE' to `sv:de' while leaving `LANG' to `sv'.
+   You might think that the country code specification is redundant.
+But in fact, some languages have dialects in different countries.  For
+example, `de_AT' is used for Austria, and `pt_BR' for Brazil.  The
+country code serves to distinguish the dialects.
+
+   The locale naming convention of `LL_CC', with `LL' denoting the
+language and `CC' denoting the country, is the one use on systems based
+on GNU libc.  On other systems, some variations of this scheme are
+used, such as `LL' or `LL_CC.ENCODING'.  You can get the list of
+locales supported by your system for your country by running the command
+`locale -a | grep '^LL''.
+
+   Not all programs have translations for all languages.  By default, an
+English message is shown in place of a nonexistent translation.  If you
+understand other languages, you can set up a priority list of languages.
+This is done through a different environment variable, called
+`LANGUAGE'.  GNU `gettext' gives preference to `LANGUAGE' over `LANG'
+for the purpose of message handling, but you still need to have `LANG'
+set to the primary language; this is required by other parts of the
+system libraries.  For example, some Swedish users who would rather
+read translations in German than English for when Swedish is not
+available, set `LANGUAGE' to `sv:de' while leaving `LANG' to `sv_SE'.
+
+   Special advice for Norwegian users: The language code for Norwegian
+bokma*l changed from `no' to `nb' recently (in 2003).  During the
+transition period, while some message catalogs for this language are
+installed under `nb' and some older ones under `no', it's recommended
+for Norwegian users to set `LANGUAGE' to `nb:no' so that both newer and
+older translations are used.
+
+   In the `LANGUAGE' environment variable, but not in the `LANG'
+environment variable, `LL_CC' combinations can be abbreviated as `LL'
+to denote the language's main dialect.  For example, `de' is equivalent
+to `de_DE' (German as spoken in Germany), and `pt' to `pt_PT'
+(Portuguese as spoken in Portugal) in this context.

+
+Using `gettext' in new packages
+===============================
+
+If you are writing a freely available program and want to
+internationalize it you are welcome to use GNU `gettext' in your
+package.  Of course you have to respect the GNU Library General Public
+License which covers the use of the GNU `gettext' library.  This means
+in particular that even non-free programs can use `libintl' as a shared
+library, whereas only free software can use `libintl' as a static
+library or use modified versions of `libintl'.
+
+   Once the sources are changed appropriately and the setup can handle
+the use of `gettext' the only thing missing are the translations.  The
+Free Translation Project is also available for packages which are not
+developed inside the GNU project.  Therefore the information given above
+applies also for every other Free Software Project.  Contact
+`translation@iro.umontreal.ca' to make the `.pot' files available to
+the translation teams.

+	* Version 0.14.1 released.
 
-	* First official release.  This directory contains all the code
-	needed to internationalize own packages.  It provides functions
-	which allow to use the X/Open catgets function with an interface
-	like the Uniforum gettext function.  For system which does not
-	have neither of those a complete implementation is provided.

+dnl Macro to add for using GNU gettext.
+
+dnl Usage: AM_GNU_GETTEXT([INTLSYMBOL], [NEEDSYMBOL], [INTLDIR]).
+dnl INTLSYMBOL can be one of 'external', 'no-libtool', 'use-libtool'. The
+dnl    default (if it is not specified or empty) is 'no-libtool'.
+dnl    INTLSYMBOL should be 'external' for packages with no intl directory,
+dnl    and 'no-libtool' or 'use-libtool' for packages with an intl directory.
+dnl    If INTLSYMBOL is 'use-libtool', then a libtool library
+dnl    $(top_builddir)/intl/libintl.la will be created (shared and/or static,
+dnl    depending on --{enable,disable}-{shared,static} and on the presence of
+dnl    AM-DISABLE-SHARED). If INTLSYMBOL is 'no-libtool', a static library
+dnl    $(top_builddir)/intl/libintl.a will be created.
+dnl If NEEDSYMBOL is specified and is 'need-ngettext', then GNU gettext
+dnl    implementations (in libc or libintl) without the ngettext() function
+dnl    will be ignored.  If NEEDSYMBOL is specified and is
+dnl    'need-formatstring-macros', then GNU gettext implementations that don't
+dnl    support the ISO C 99 <inttypes.h> formatstring macros will be ignored.
+dnl INTLDIR is used to find the intl libraries.  If empty,
+dnl    the value `$(top_builddir)/intl/' is used.
+dnl
+dnl The result of the configuration is one of three cases:
+dnl 1) GNU gettext, as included in the intl subdirectory, will be compiled
+dnl    and used.
+dnl    Catalog format: GNU --> install in $(datadir)
+dnl    Catalog extension: .mo after installation, .gmo in source tree
+dnl 2) GNU gettext has been found in the system's C library.
+dnl    Catalog format: GNU --> install in $(datadir)
+dnl    Catalog extension: .mo after installation, .gmo in source tree
+dnl 3) No internationalization, always use English msgid.
+dnl    Catalog format: none
+dnl    Catalog extension: none
+dnl If INTLSYMBOL is 'external', only cases 2 and 3 can occur.
+dnl The use of .gmo is historical (it was needed to avoid overwriting the
+dnl GNU format catalogs when building on a platform with an X/Open gettext),
+dnl but we keep it in order not to force irrelevant filename changes on the
+dnl maintainers.
