SUMMARY = "A library for text mode user interfaces"

DESCRIPTION = "Newt is a programming library for color text mode, widget based user \
interfaces.  Newt can be used to add stacked windows, entry widgets, \
checkboxes, radio buttons, labels, plain text fields, scrollbars, \
etc., to text mode user interfaces.  This package also contains the \
shared library needed by programs built with newt, as well as a \
/usr/bin/dialog replacement called whiptail.  Newt is based on the \
slang library."
