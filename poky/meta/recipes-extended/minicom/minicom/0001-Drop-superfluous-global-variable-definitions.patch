Subject: [PATCH 1/3] Drop superfluous global variable definitions

The file minicom.c, by including the minicom.h header, already defines
the global variables 'dial_user' and 'dial_pass'. The object file
minicom.o is always linked to dial.o. Thus the definitions in dial.c
can be dropped.

This fixes linking with gcc 10 which uses -fno-common by default,
disallowing multiple global variable definitions.
