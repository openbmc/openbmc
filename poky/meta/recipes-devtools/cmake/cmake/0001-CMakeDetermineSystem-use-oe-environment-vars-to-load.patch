Subject: [PATCH] CMakeDetermineSystem: use oe environment vars to load default
 toolchain file in sdk

Passing the toolchain by:

 - shell aliases does not work if cmake is called by a script
 - unconditionally by a wrapper script causes cmake to believe it is
   configuring things when it is not (for example, `cmake --build` breaks).

The OE_CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE variable is only used as a default if no
toolchain is explicitly specified.

Setting the CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE cmake variable is marked as cached
because '-D' options are cache entries themselves.

Upstream-Status: Inappropriate [oe-core specific]
