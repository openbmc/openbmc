Subject: [PATCH] setup.py: do not report missing dependencies for disabled
 modules

Reporting those missing dependencies is misleading as the modules would not
have been built anyway. This particularly matters in oe-core's automated
build completeness checker which relies on the report.

Upstream-Status: Inappropriate [oe-core specific]
