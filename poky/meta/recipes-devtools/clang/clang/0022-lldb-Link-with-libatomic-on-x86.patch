Subject: [PATCH] lldb: Link with libatomic on x86

cmake atomic check is not sufficient for i686 target where clang14 still
generates __atomic_store calls but the check does not entail this
function and happily thinks that compiler can resolve all atomic via intrinsics
on i686, but thats not the case, ideally the check for determining
atomic operation should be make more robust but until then lets ask to
link with libatomic on i686/linux

Upstream-Status: Inappropriate [OE-Specific]
