Subject: [PATCH] Change verify_SSL default to 1, add ENV var to enable
 insecure default

- Changes the `verify_SSL` default parameter from `0` to `1`

  Based on patch by Dominic Hargreaves:
  https://salsa.debian.org/perl-team/interpreter/perl/-/commit/1490431e40e22052f75a0b3449f1f53cbd27ba92

  Fixes CVE-2023-31486

- Add check for `$ENV{PERL_HTTP_TINY_SSL_INSECURE_BY_DEFAULT}` that
  enables the previous insecure default behaviour if set to `1`.

  This provides a workaround for users who encounter problems with the
  new `verify_SSL` default.

  Example to disable certificate checks:
  ```
    $ PERL_HTTP_TINY_SSL_INSECURE_BY_DEFAULT=1 ./script.pl
  ```

- Updates to documentation:
  - Describe changing the verify_SSL value
  - Describe the escape-hatch environment variable
  - Remove rationale for not enabling verify_SSL
  - Add missing certificate search paths
  - Replace "SSL" with "TLS/SSL" where appropriate
  - Use "machine-in-the-middle" instead of "man-in-the-middle"

Upstream-Status: Backport [https://github.com/chansen/p5-http-tiny/commit/77f557ef84698efeb6eed04e4a9704eaf85b741d]
