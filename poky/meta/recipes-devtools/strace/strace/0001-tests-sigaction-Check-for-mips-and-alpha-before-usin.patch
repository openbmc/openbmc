Subject: [PATCH] tests/sigaction: Check for mips and alpha before using
 sa_restorer

local structure does not define restorer member for mips and alpha
in definition, we need to match that assumption here where they are
being set

Fixes
| ../../strace-4.18/tests/sigaction.c:177:36: error: 'struct_set_sa {aka struct set_sa}' has no member named 'restorer'
|  # define SA_RESTORER_ARGS , new_act->restorer

Upstream-Status: Pending
