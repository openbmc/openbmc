Subject: [PATCH 03/12] ltmain.in: Add missing sysroot to library path

When using a sysroot we should append it to libdir, which is helpful in
cross builds as the system is staged in the sysroot. For normal builds,
i.e. when lt_sysroot is not set, it will still behave the same and add
-L/usr/lib to the relink command.
