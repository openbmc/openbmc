SUMMARY = "tool for automating interactive applications according to a script"
DESCRIPTION = "Expect is a tool for automating interactive applications according to a script. \
Following the script, Expect knows what can be expected from a program and what \
the correct response should be. Expect is also useful for testing these same \
applications. And by adding Tk, you can also wrap interactive applications in \
X11 GUIs. An interpreted language provides branching and high-level control \
structures to direct the dialogue. In addition, the user can take control and \
interact directly when desired, afterward returning control to the script. \
