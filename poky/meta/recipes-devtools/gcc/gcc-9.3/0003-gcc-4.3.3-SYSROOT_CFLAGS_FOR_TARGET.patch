Subject: [PATCH 03/39] gcc-4.3.3: SYSROOT_CFLAGS_FOR_TARGET

Before committing, I noticed that PR/32161 was marked as a dup of PR/32009, but my previous patch did not fix it.

This alternative patch is better because it lets you just use CFLAGS_FOR_TARGET to set the compilation flags for libgcc. Since bootstrapped target libraries are never compiled with the native compiler, it makes little sense to use different flags for stage1 and later stages. And it also makes little sense to use a different variable than CFLAGS_FOR_TARGET.

Other changes I had to do include:

- moving the creation of default CFLAGS_FOR_TARGET from Makefile.am to configure.ac, because otherwise the BOOT_CFLAGS are substituted into CFLAGS_FOR_TARGET (which is "-O2 -g $(CFLAGS)") via $(CFLAGS). It is also cleaner this way though.

- passing the right CFLAGS to configure scripts as exported environment variables

I also stopped passing LIBCFLAGS to configure scripts since they are unused in the whole src tree. And I updated the documentation as H-P reminded me to do.

Bootstrapped/regtested i686-pc-linux-gnu, will commit to 4.4 shortly. Ok for 4.3?
