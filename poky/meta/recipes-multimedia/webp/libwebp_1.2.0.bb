SUMMARY = "WebP is an image format designed for the Web"
DESCRIPTION = "WebP is a method of lossy and lossless compression that can be \
               used on a large variety of photographic, translucent and \
               graphical images found on the web. The degree of lossy \
               compression is adjustable so a user can choose the trade-off \
               between file size and image quality. WebP typically achieves \
               an average of 30% more compression than JPEG and JPEG 2000, \
               without loss of image quality."
