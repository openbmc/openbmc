Subject: [PATCH] Detect warning options during configure

Certain options maybe compiler specific therefore its better
to detect them before use.

nfs_error copies the format string and appends newline to it
but compiler can forget that it was format string since its not
same fmt string that was passed. Ignore the warning

Wdiscarded-qualifiers is gcc specific and this is no longer needed
