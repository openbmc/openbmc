Subject: [PATCH] Fix: sched_stat_runtime changed in Linux 6.6.66

The following commit has been backported into the 6.6.y branch.

See upstream commit:

    commit 5fe6ec8f6ab549b6422e41551abb51802bd48bc7
    Author: Peter Zijlstra <peterz@infradead.org>
    Date:   Mon Nov 6 13:41:43 2023 +0100

        sched: Remove vruntime from trace_sched_stat_runtime()

        Tracing the runtime delta makes sense, observer can sum over time.
        Tracing the absolute vruntime makes less sense, inconsistent:
        absolute-vs-delta, but also vruntime delta can be computed from
        runtime delta.

        Removing the vruntime thing also makes the two tracepoint sites
        identical, allowing to unify the code in a later patch.
