Subject: [PATCH] src/Kbuild: change missing CONFIG_TRACEPOINTS to warning

Taken from a previous patch to the main lttng-modules Makefile, by
Otavio Salvador:

  The lttng-modules are being pulled by the tools-profile image feature,
  however, not every kernel has the CONFIG_TRACEPOINTS feature enabled.

  This change makes the build do not fail when CONFIG_TRACEPOINTS is not
  available, allowing it to be kept being pulled by default.

Upstream-Status: Inappropriate [embedded specific]
