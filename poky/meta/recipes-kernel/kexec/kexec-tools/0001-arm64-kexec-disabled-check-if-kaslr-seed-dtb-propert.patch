Subject: [PATCH] arm64: kexec: disabled check if kaslr-seed dtb property was
 wiped

Kexec when loading arm64 kernel checks if chosen/kaslr-seed dtb property is
wiped. It's a good assertion to verify proper behavior of kernel. However,
if bootloader creates and fills kaslr-seed property and kernel is not
configured with CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_BASE then logic of reading and wiping
kaslr-seed does not run. As a result kaslr-seed property is not zero and when
kexec tries to load secondary kernel it fails with the following message:

setup_2nd_dtb: kaslr-seed is not wiped to 0.
kexec: setup_2nd_dtb failed.
kexec: load failed.

This was observed on Yocto Project on qemuarm64 machine with 5.8 kernel,
qemu 5.1.0. Qemu created kaslr-seed property but kernel was not configured
with CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_BASE.

Although check has some value, there is a use-case where it breaks kexec,
this patch removes it.

Note in described use-case the fact that kaslr-seed is not wiped and user
readable through /sys/firmware/fdt or
/sys/firmware/devicetree/base/chosen/kaslr-seed is not a security problem
as kaslr is disabled anyway.
