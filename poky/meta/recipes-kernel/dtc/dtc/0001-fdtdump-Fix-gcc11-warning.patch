Subject: [PATCH] fdtdump: Fix gcc11 warning

In one place, fdtdump abuses fdt_set_magic(), passing it just a small char
array instead of the full fdt header it expects.  That's relying on the
fact that in fact fdt_set_magic() will only actually access the first 4
bytes of the buffer.

This trips a new warning in GCC 11 - and it's entirely possible it was
always UB.  So, don't do that.

Upstream-Status: Backport [https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/dtc/dtc.git/patch/?id=ca16a723fa9dde9c5da80dba567f48715000e77c]
