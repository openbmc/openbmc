Subject: [PATCH 1/3] kbuild: install_headers.sh: Strip _UAPI from
 #if-defined() guards

install_headers.sh knows how to strip the _UAPI prefix from #ifdef/
ifndef and #define directives used to guard headers against multiple
or inappropriate inclusion.  Currently this does not work for guards
in the "#if defined()" style, which may be needed for non-trivial
cases.

This patch adds similar logic so that the _UAPI prefix is also
stripped from guard directives written using "#if defined()" etc.

This is not completely foolproof, but will work for simple cases of
using #if defined() to guard against inappropriate header inclusion.
