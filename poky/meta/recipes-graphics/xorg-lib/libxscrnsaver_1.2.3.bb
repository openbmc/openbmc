SUMMARY = "Xscrnsaver: X Screen Saver extension library"

DESCRIPTION = "The X Window System provides support for changing the \
image on a display screen after a user-settable period of inactivity to \
avoid burning the cathode ray tube phosphors. However, no interfaces are \
provided for the user to control the image that is drawn. This extension \
allows an external \"screen saver\" client to detect when the alternate \
image is to be displayed and to provide the graphics."
