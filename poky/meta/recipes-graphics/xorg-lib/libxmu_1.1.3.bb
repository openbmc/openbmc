DESCRIPTION = "The Xmu Library is a collection of miscellaneous (some \
might say random) utility functions that have been useful in building \
various applications and widgets. This library is required by the Athena \
Widgets. A subset of the functions that do not rely on the Athena \
Widgets (libXaw) or X Toolkit Instrinsics (libXt) are provided in a \
second library, libXmuu."
