SUMMARY = "Xt: X Toolkit Intrinsics library"

DESCRIPTION = "The Intrinsics are a programming library tailored to the \
special requirements of user interface construction within a network \
window system, specifically the X Window System. The Intrinsics and a \
widget set make up an X Toolkit. The Intrinsics provide the base \
mechanism necessary to build a wide variety of interoperating widget \
sets and application environments. The Intrinsics are a layer on top of \
Xlib, the C Library X Interface. They extend the fundamental \
abstractions provided by the X Window System while still remaining \
independent of any particular user interface policy or style."
