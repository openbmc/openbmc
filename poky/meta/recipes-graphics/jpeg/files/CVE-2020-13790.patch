Subject: [PATCH] rdppm.c: Fix buf overrun caused by bad binary PPM

This extends the fix in 1e81b0c3ea26f4ea8f56de05367469333de64a9f to
include binary PPM files with maximum values < 255, thus preventing a
malformed binary PPM input file with those specifications from
triggering an overrun of the rescale array and potentially crashing
cjpeg, TJBench, or any program that uses the tjLoadImage() function.

Fixes #433

Upstream-Status: Backport [https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/commit/3de15e0c344d11d4b90f4a47136467053eb2d09a]
CVE: CVE-2020-13790
