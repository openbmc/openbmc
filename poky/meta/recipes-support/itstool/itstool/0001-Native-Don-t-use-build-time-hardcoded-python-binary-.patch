Subject: [PATCH] Native: Don't use build time hardcoded python binary path.
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This is same patch as used for target build except that we do not use the
'-S' and '-s' option because '-S' is relatively young [1] and elder build-host
don't support it [2]

Upstream-Status: Inappropriate [OE specific]
