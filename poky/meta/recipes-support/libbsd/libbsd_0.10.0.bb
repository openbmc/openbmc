SUMMARY = "Library of utility functions from BSD systems"
DESCRIPTION = "This library provides useful functions commonly found on BSD systems, \
               and lacking on others like GNU systems, thus making it easier to port \
               projects with strong BSD origins, without needing to embed the same \
               code over and over again on each project."
