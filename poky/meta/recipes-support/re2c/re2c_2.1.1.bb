SUMMARY = "Tool for writing very fast and very flexible scanners"
DESCRIPTION = "A free and open-source lexer generator for C, C++ and Go. It compiles regular expressions to determinisitic finite automata and encodes the automata in the form of a program in the target language. Unlike any other such tool, re2c focuses on generating high efficient code for regular expression matching. As a result this allows a much broader range of use than any traditional lexer."
