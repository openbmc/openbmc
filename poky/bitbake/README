Bitbake
=======

BitBake is a generic task execution engine that allows shell and Python tasks to be run
efficiently and in parallel while working within complex inter-task dependency constraints.
One of BitBake's main users, OpenEmbedded, takes this core and builds embedded Linux software
stacks using a task-oriented approach.

For information about Bitbake, see the OpenEmbedded website:
    http://www.openembedded.org/

Bitbake plain documentation can be found under the doc directory or its integrated
html version at the Yocto Project website:

Please refer to
http://www.openembedded.org/wiki/How_to_submit_a_patch_to_OpenEmbedded
for guidelines on how to submit patches, just note that the latter documentation is intended
for OpenEmbedded (and its core) not bitbake patches (bitbake-devel@lists.openembedded.org)
but in general main guidelines apply. Once the commit(s) have been created, the way to send
the patch is through git-send-email. For example, to send the last commit (HEAD) on current
branch, type:

    git send-email -M -1 --to bitbake-devel@lists.openembedded.org
