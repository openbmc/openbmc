<title>Concepts and Reference</title>

    <para>
        In order to configure and use Toaster, you should understand some
        concepts and have some basic command reference material available.
        This final chapter provides conceptual information on layer sources,
        releases, and JSON configuration files.
        Also provided is a quick look at some useful
        <filename>manage.py</filename> commands that are Toaster-specific.
        Information on <filename>manage.py</filename> commands does exist
        across the Web and the information in this manual by no means
        attempts to provide a command comprehensive reference.

        <title>Layer Source</title>

        <para>
            In general, a "layer source" is a source of information about
            existing layers.
            In particular, we are concerned with layers that you can use
            with the Yocto Project and Toaster.
            This chapter describes a particular type of layer source called
            a "layer index."
        </para>

        <para>
            A layer index is a web application that contains information
            about a set of custom layers.
            A good example of an existing layer index is the
            OpenEmbedded Layer Index.
            A public instance of this layer index exists at
            <ulink url='http://layers.openembedded.org'></ulink>.
            You can find the code for this layer index's web application at
            <ulink url='http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit/cgit.cgi/layerindex-web/'></ulink>.
        </para>

        <para>
            When you tie a layer source into Toaster, it can query the layer
            source through a
            <ulink url='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer'>REST</ulink>
            API, store the information about the layers in the Toaster
            database, and then show the information to users.
            Users are then able to view that information and build layers
            from Toaster itself without worrying about cloning or editing
            the BitBake layers configuration file
            <filename>bblayers.conf</filename>.
        </para>

        <para>
            Tying a layer source into Toaster is convenient when you have
            many custom layers that need to be built on a regular basis by
            a community of developers.
            In fact, Toaster comes pre-configured with the OpenEmbedded
            Metadata Index.
            <note>
                You do not have to use a layer source to use Toaster.
                Tying into a layer source is optional.

            <title>Setting Up and Using a Layer Source</title>

            <para>
                To use your own layer source, you need to set up the layer
                source and then tie it into Toaster.
                This section describes how to tie into a layer index in a manner
                similar to the way Toaster ties into the OpenEmbedded Metadata
                Index.

                <title>Understanding Your Layers</title>

                <para>
                    The obvious first step for using a layer index is to have
                    several custom layers that developers build and access using
                    the Yocto Project on a regular basis.
                    This set of layers needs to exist and you need to be
                    familiar with where they reside.
                    You will need that information when you set up the
                    code for the web application that "hooks" into your set of
                    layers.
                </para>

                <para>
                    If you want Toaster to use your layer index, you must host
                    the web application in a server to which Toaster can
                    connect.
                    You also need to give Toaster the information about your
                    layer index.
                    In other words, you have to configure Toaster to use your
                    layer index.
                    This section describes two methods by which you can
                    configure and use your layer index.
                </para>

                <para>
                    In the previous section, the code for the OpenEmbedded
                    Metadata Index (i.e.
                    <ulink url='http://layers.openembedded.org'></ulink>) was
                    referenced.
                    You can use this code, which is at

                    as a base to create your own layer index.

                    <para>
                        Access the administration interface through a
                        browser by entering the URL of your Toaster instance and
                        adding "<filename>/admin</filename>" to the end of the
                        URL.
                        As an example, if you are running Toaster locally, use
                        the following URL:
                        <literallayout class='monospaced'>

                    <para>
                        The administration interface has a "Layer sources"
                        section that includes an "Add layer source" button.
                        Click that button and provide the required information.
                        Make sure you select "layerindex" as the layer source type.

                        The Django fixture feature overrides the default layer
                        server when you use it to specify a custom URL. To use
                        the fixture feature, create (or edit) the file
                        <filename>bitbake/lib/toaster.orm/fixtures/custom.xml</filename>,
                        and then set the following Toaster setting to your
                        custom URL:
                        <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     &lt;?xml version="1.0" ?&gt;
     &lt;django-objects version="1.0"&gt;

     &lt;django-objects&gt;
                        </literallayout>
                        When you start Toaster for the first time, or if you
                        delete the file <filename>toaster.sqlite</filename> and restart,
                        the database will populate cleanly from this layer index server.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Once the information has been updated, verify the new layer
                        information is available by using the Toaster web interface.
                        To do that, visit the "All compatible layers" page inside a
                        Toaster project. The layers from your layer source should be
                        listed there.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        If you change the information in your layer index server,
                        refresh the Toaster database by running the following command:
                        <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ bitbake/lib/toaster/manage.py lsupdates
                        </literallayout>
                        If Toaster can reach the API URL, you should see a message
                        telling you that Toaster is updating the layer source information.

        <para>
            When you create a Toaster project using the web interface,
            you are asked to choose a "Release."
            In the context of Toaster, the term "Release" refers to a set of
            layers and a BitBake version the OpenEmbedded build system uses
            to build something.
            As shipped, Toaster is pre-configured with releases that
            correspond to Yocto Project release branches.
            However, you can modify, delete, and create new releases
            according to your needs.
            This section provides some background information on releases.

                Of course, you can always configure Toaster to use any
                release.
                For example, you might want your project to build against a
                specific commit of any of the "out-of-the-box" releases.
                Or, you might want your project to build against different

                to customize the values that go into to the database.
                Customization is additive,

                You use the <filename>orm/fixtures/custom.xml</filename> file

                file images, and layers.
                When creating a new project, you can use the file to define
                the offered alternate project release selections.
                For example, you can add one or more additional selections that
                present custom layer sets or distros, and any other local or proprietary
                content.

                files by defining the section shown below in the
                <filename>settings.xml</filename> file.
                For example, this option is particularly useful if your custom

                    This section defines the default distro value for new projects.
                    By default, it reserves the first Toaster Setting record "1".
                    The following demonstrates how to set the project default value
                    for
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-DISTRO'><filename>DISTRO</filename></ulink>:

                       You can override other default project values by adding
                       additional Toaster Setting sections such as any of the
                       settings coming from the <filename>settings.xml</filename>
                       file.
                       Also, you can add custom values that are included in the
                       BitBake environment.
                       The "pk" values must be unique.
                       By convention, values that set default project values have a
                       "DEFCONF" prefix.

        <title>Remote Toaster Monitoring</title>

        <para>
            Toaster has an API that allows remote management applications to
            directly query the state of the Toaster server and its builds
            in a machine-to-machine manner.
            This API uses the
            <ulink url='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer'>REST</ulink>
            interface and the transfer of JSON files.
            For example, you might
            monitor a build inside a container through well supported
            known HTTP ports in order to easily access a Toaster server
            inside the container.
            In this example, when you use this direct JSON API, you avoid
            having web page parsing against the display the user sees.

            <para>
                Before you use remote Toaster monitoring, you should do
                a health check.
                To do this, ping the Toaster server using the following call
                to see if it is still alive:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     http://<replaceable>host</replaceable>:<replaceable>port</replaceable>/health

                and <replaceable>port</replaceable>.

                Be sure to provide values for <replaceable>host</replaceable>
                and <replaceable>port</replaceable>.
                The output is a JSON file that itemizes all builds in
                progress.
                This file includes the time in seconds since each
                respective build started as well as the progress of the
                cloning, parsing, and task execution.
                The following is sample output for a build in progress:

                        For non-default database configurations, it is possible
                        that you can use <filename>manage.py</filename> commands
                        from a directory other than the Build Directory.
                        To do so, the
                        <filename>toastermain/settings.py</filename> file must be
                        configured to point to the correct database backend.

        <section id='toaster-command-buildslist'>
            <title><filename>buildslist</filename></title>

            <para>
                The <filename>buildslist</filename> command lists all builds
                that Toaster has recorded.
                Access the command as follows:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ bitbake/lib/toaster/manage.py buildslist
                </literallayout>
                The command returns a list, which includes numeric
                identifications, of the builds that Toaster has recorded in the
                current database.
            </para>

            <para>
                You need to run the <filename>buildslist</filename> command
                first to identify existing builds in the database before
                using the
                <link linkend='toaster-command-builddelete'><filename>builddelete</filename></link>
                command.
                Here is an example that assumes default repository and build
                directory names:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ cd ~/poky/build
     $ python ../bitbake/lib/toaster/manage.py buildslist
                </literallayout>
                If your Toaster database had only one build, the above
                <filename>buildslist</filename> command would return something
                like the following:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     1: qemux86 poky core-image-minimal
                </literallayout>
            </para>
        </section>

        <section id='toaster-command-builddelete'>
            <title><filename>builddelete</filename></title>

            <para>
                The <filename>builddelete</filename> command deletes data
                associated with a build.
                Access the command as follows:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ bitbake/lib/toaster/manage.py builddelete <replaceable>build_id</replaceable>
                </literallayout>
                The command deletes all the build data for the specified
                <replaceable>build_id</replaceable>.
                This command is useful for removing old and unused data from
                the database.
            </para>

            <para>
                Prior to running the <filename>builddelete</filename>
                command, you need to get the ID associated with builds
                by using the
                <link linkend='toaster-command-buildslist'><filename>buildslist</filename></link>
                command.
            </para>

        <section id='toaster-command-perf'>
            <title><filename>perf</filename></title>

            <para>
                The <filename>perf</filename> command measures Toaster
                performance.
                Access the command as follows:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ bitbake/lib/toaster/manage.py perf
                </literallayout>
                The command is a sanity check that returns page loading
                times in order to identify performance problems.
            </para>
        </section>

        <section id='toaster-command-checksettings'>
            <title><filename>checksettings</filename></title>

            <para>
                The <filename>checksettings</filename> command verifies
                existing Toaster settings.
                Access the command as follows:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ bitbake/lib/toaster/manage.py checksettings
                </literallayout>
                Toaster uses settings that are based on the
                database to configure the building tasks.
                The <filename>checksettings</filename> command verifies that
                the database settings are valid in the sense that they have
                the minimal information needed to start a build.
            </para>

            <para>
                In order for the <filename>checksettings</filename> command
                to work, the database must be correctly set up and not have
                existing data.
                To be sure the database is ready, you can run the following:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ bitbake/lib/toaster/mana​ge.py syncdb
     $ bitbake/lib/toaster/mana​ge.py migrate orm
     $ bitbake/lib/toaster/mana​ge.py migrate bldcontrol
                </literallayout>
                After running these commands, you can run the
                <filename>checksettings</filename> command.
            </para>
        </section>

        <section id='toaster-command-runbuilds'>
            <title><filename>runbuilds</filename></title>

            <para>
                The <filename>runbuilds</filename> command launches
                scheduled builds.
                Access the command as follows:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ bitbake/lib/toaster/manage.py runbuilds
                </literallayout>
                The <filename>runbuilds</filename> command checks if
                scheduled builds exist in the database and then launches them
                per schedule.
                The command returns after the builds start but before they
                complete.
                The Toaster Logging Interface records and updates the database
                when the builds complete.
