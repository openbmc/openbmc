        <title>What is the Yocto Project?</title>

        <para>
            The Yocto Project is an open source collaboration project
            that helps developers create custom Linux-based systems that are
            designed for embedded products regardless of the product's hardware
            architecture.
            Yocto Project provides a flexible toolset and a development
            environment that allows embedded device developers across the
            world to collaborate through shared technologies, software stacks,
            configurations, and best practices used to create these tailored
            Linux images.

        <para>
            Thousands of developers worldwide have discovered that Yocto
            Project provides advantages in both systems and applications
            development, archival and management benefits, and customizations
            used for speed, footprint, and memory utilization.
            The project is a standard when it comes to delivering embedded
            software stacks.
            The project allows software customizations and build interchange
            for multiple hardware platforms as well as software stacks that
            can be maintained and scaled.

            <title>Features</title>

            <para>
                The following list describes features and advantages of the
                Yocto Project:
                <itemizedlist>
                    <listitem><para>
                        <emphasis>Widely Adopted Across the Industry:</emphasis>
                        Semiconductor, operating system, software, and
                        service vendors exist whose products and services
                        adopt and support the Yocto Project.
                        For a look at the Yocto Project community and
                        the companies involved with the Yocto
                        Project, see the "COMMUNITY" and "ECOSYSTEM" tabs

                    <listitem><para>
                        <emphasis>Architecture Agnostic:</emphasis>
                        Yocto Project supports Intel, ARM, MIPS, AMD, PPC
                        and other architectures.
                        Most ODMs, OSVs, and chip vendors create and supply
                        BSPs that support their hardware.
                        If you have custom silicon, you can create a BSP
                        that supports that architecture.</para>

                        <para>Aside from lots of architecture support, the
                        Yocto Project fully supports a wide range of device
                        emulation through the Quick EMUlator (QEMU).
                        </para></listitem>
                    <listitem><para>
                        <emphasis>Images and Code Transfer Easily:</emphasis>
                        Yocto Project output can easily move between
                        architectures without moving to new development
                        environments.
                        Additionally, if you have used the Yocto Project to
                        create an image or application and you find yourself
                        not able to support it, commercial Linux vendors such
                        as Wind River, Mentor Graphics, Timesys, and ENEA could
                        take it and provide ongoing support.
                        These vendors have offerings that are built using
                        the Yocto Project.

                        <emphasis>Flexibility:</emphasis>
                        Corporations use the Yocto Project many different ways.
                        One example is to create an internal Linux distribution
                        as a code base the corporation can use across multiple
                        product groups.
                        Through customization and layering, a project group
                        can leverage the base Linux distribution to create
                        a distribution that works for their product needs.
                        </para></listitem>
                    <listitem><para>
                        <emphasis>Ideal for Constrained Embedded and IoT devices:</emphasis>
                        Unlike a full Linux distribution, you can use the
                        Yocto Project to create exactly what you need for
                        embedded devices.
                        You only add the feature support or packages that you
                        absolutely need for the device.
                        For devices that have display hardware, you can use
                        available system components such as X11, GTK+, Qt,
                        Clutter, and SDL (among others) to create a rich user
                        experience.
                        For devices that do not have a display or where you
                        want to use alternative UI frameworks, you can choose
                        to not install these components.

                        <emphasis>Comprehensive Toolchain Capabilities:</emphasis>
                        Toolchains for supported architectures satisfy most
                        use cases.
                        However, if your hardware supports features that are
                        not part of a standard toolchain, you can easily
                        customize that toolchain through specification of
                        platform-specific tuning parameters.
                        And, should you need to use a third-party toolchain,
                        mechanisms built into the Yocto Project allow for that.

                        <emphasis>Mechanism Rules Over Policy:</emphasis>
                        Focusing on mechanism rather than policy ensures that
                        you are free to set policies based on the needs of your
                        design instead of adopting decisions enforced by some
                        system software provider.

                        groups related functionality into separate bundles.
                        You can incrementally add these grouped functionalities
                        to your project as needed.
                        Using layers to isolate and group functionality
                        reduces project complexity and redundancy, allows you
                        to easily extend the system, make customizations,
                        and keep functionality organized.

                        You can build and rebuild individual packages as
                        needed.
                        Yocto Project accomplishes this through its

                        (sstate) scheme.
                        Being able to build and debug components individually
                        eases project development.

                        predictably in October and April.
                        The most recent two releases support point releases
                        to address common vulnerabilities and exposures.
                        This predictability is crucial for projects based on
                        the Yocto Project and allows development teams to
                        plan activities.

                        For open source projects, the value of community is
                        very important.
                        Support forums, expertise, and active developers who
                        continue to push the Yocto Project forward are readily

                        The Yocto Project allows you to be very specific about
                        dependencies and achieves very high percentages of
                        binary reproducibility (e.g. 99.8% for
                        <filename>core-image-minimal</filename>).
                        When distributions are not specific about which
                        packages are pulled in and in what order to support
                        dependencies, other build systems can arbitrarily
                        include packages.

                        many different ways to accomplish similar tasks.
                        It can be difficult to choose how to proceed when
                        varying methods exist by which to accomplish a given

                        Beyond the simple tutorial stage, understanding what
                        changes need to be made for your particular design

                        could be confusing if you are used to traditional
                        desktop and server software development.
                        In a desktop development environment, mechanisms exist
                        to easily pull and install new packages, which are
                        typically pre-compiled binaries from servers accessible
                        over the Internet.
                        Using the Yocto Project, you must modify your
                        configuration and rebuild to add additional packages.

                        When developing code to run on a target, compilation,
                        execution, and testing done on the actual target
                        can be faster than running a BitBake build on a
                        development host and then deploying binaries to the
                        target for test.
                        While the Yocto Project does support development tools
                        on the target, the additional step of integrating your
                        changes back into the Yocto Project build environment
                        would be required.
                        Yocto Project supports an intermediate approach that
                        involves making changes on the development system
                        within the BitBake environment and then deploying only
                        the updated packages to the target.</para>

                        You can deploy these packages into the running system
                        on the target by using utilities on the target such
                        as <filename>rpm</filename> or

                        <emphasis>Initial Build Times Can be Significant:</emphasis>
                        Long initial build times are unfortunately unavoidable
                        due to the large number of packages initially built
                        from scratch for a fully functioning Linux system.
                        Once that initial build is completed, however, the
                        shared-state (sstate) cache mechanism Yocto Project

        <title>The Yocto Project Layer Model</title>

        <para>
            The Yocto Project's "Layer Model" is a development model for
            embedded and IoT Linux creation that distinguishes the
            Yocto Project from other simple build systems.
            The Layer Model simultaneously supports collaboration and
            customization.
            Layers are repositories that contain related sets of instructions
            that tell the
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#build-system-term'>OpenEmbedded build system</ulink>
            what to do.
            You can collaborate, share, and reuse layers.
        </para>

        <para>
            Layers can contain changes to previous instructions or settings
            at any time.
            This powerful override capability is what allows you to customize
            previously supplied collaborative or community layers to suit your
            product requirements.
        </para>

        <para>
            You use different layers to logically separate information in your
            build.
            As an example, you could have BSP, GUI, distro configuration,
            middleware, or application layers.
            Putting your entire build into one layer limits and complicates
            future customization and reuse.
            Isolating information into layers, on the other hand, helps
            simplify future customizations and reuse.
            You might find it tempting to keep everything in one layer when
            working on a single project.
            However, the more modular your Metadata, the easier
            it is to cope with future changes.

        <para>
            To illustrate how layers are used to keep things modular, consider
            machine customizations.
            These types of customizations typically reside in a special layer,
            rather than a general layer, called a BSP Layer.
            Furthermore, the machine customizations should be isolated from
            recipes and Metadata that support a new GUI environment,
            for example.
            This situation gives you a couple of layers: one for the machine
            configurations, and one for the GUI environment.
            It is important to understand, however, that the BSP layer can
            still make machine-specific additions to recipes within the GUI
            environment layer without polluting the GUI layer itself
            with those machine-specific changes.
            You can accomplish this through a recipe that is a BitBake append
            (<filename>.bbappend</filename>) file, which is described later
            in this section.
            <note>
                For general information on BSP layer structure, see the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_BSP_URL;'>Yocto Project Board Support Packages (BSP) Developer's Guide</ulink>.

            The
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#source-directory'>Source Directory</ulink>
            contains both general layers and BSP layers right out of the box.
            You can easily identify layers that ship with a Yocto Project
            release in the Source Directory by their names.
            Layers typically have names that begin with the string
            <filename>meta-</filename>.
            <note>
                It is not a requirement that a layer name begin with the
                prefix <filename>meta-</filename>, but it is a commonly
                accepted standard in the Yocto Project community.
            </note>

            <ulink url='https://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/'>tree view</ulink>
            of the <filename>poky</filename> repository, you will see several

            <filename>meta-poky</filename>, and
            <filename>meta-yocto-bsp</filename>.
            Each of these repositories represents a distinct layer.

                        This command-line tool is available as part of the
                        extensible SDK (eSDK) and is its cornerstone.
                        You can use <filename>devtool</filename> to help build,
                        test, and package software within the eSDK.
                        You can use the tool to optionally integrate what you
                        build into an image built by the OpenEmbedded build
                        system.</para>

                        <para>The <filename>devtool</filename> command employs
                        a number of sub-commands that allow you to add, modify,
                        and upgrade recipes.
                        As with the OpenEmbedded build system, “recipes”
                        represent software packages within
                        <filename>devtool</filename>.
                        When you use <filename>devtool add</filename>, a recipe
                        is automatically created.
                        When you use <filename>devtool modify</filename>, the
                        specified existing recipe is used in order to determine
                        where to get the source code and how to patch it.
                        In both cases, an environment is set up so that when
                        you build the recipe a source tree that is under your
                        control is used in order to allow you to make changes
                        to the source as desired.
                        By default, both new recipes and the source go into
                        a “workspace” directory under the eSDK.
                        The <filename>devtool upgrade</filename> command

                        The eSDK makes it easy to add new applications and

                        AutoBuilder is a project that automates build tests

                        <emphasis>Cross-Prelink:</emphasis>
                        Prelinking is the process of pre-computing the load
                        addresses and link tables generated by the dynamic
                        linker as compared to doing this at runtime.
                        Doing this ahead of time results in performance
                        improvements when the application is launched and
                        reduced memory usage for libraries shared by many
                        applications.</para>

                        <para>Historically, cross-prelink is a variant of
                        prelink, which was conceived by
                        <ulink url='http://people.redhat.com/jakub/prelink.pdf'>Jakub Jel&iacute;nek</ulink>
                        a number of years ago.
                        Both prelink and cross-prelink are maintained in the
                        same repository albeit on separate branches.
                        By providing an emulated runtime dynamic linker
                        (i.e. <filename>glibc</filename>-derived
                        <filename>ld.so</filename> emulation), the
                        cross-prelink project extends the prelink software’s
                        ability to prelink a sysroot environment.
                        Additionally, the cross-prelink software enables the
                        ability to work in sysroot style environments.</para>

                        <para>The dynamic linker determines standard load
                        address calculations based on a variety of factors
                        such as mapping addresses, library usage, and library
                        function conflicts.
                        The prelink tool uses this information, from the
                        dynamic linker, to determine unique load addresses
                        for executable and linkable format (ELF) binaries
                        that are shared libraries and dynamically linked.
                        The prelink tool modifies these ELF binaries with the
                        pre-computed information.
                        The result is faster loading and often lower memory
                        consumption because more of the library code can
                        be re-used from shared Copy-On-Write (COW) pages.
                        </para>

                        <para>The original upstream prelink project only
                        supports running prelink on the end target device
                        due to the reliance on the target device’s dynamic
                        linker.
                        This restriction causes issues when developing a
                        cross-compiled system.
                        The cross-prelink adds a synthesized dynamic loader
                        that runs on the host, thus permitting cross-prelinking
                        without ever having to run on a read-write target
                        filesystem.

                        The Yocto Project and the OpenEmbedded Project both
                        maintain the OpenEmbedded-Core.
                        You can find the OE-Core metadata in the Yocto Project

                        <para>Historically, the Yocto Project integrated the

                        source repository reference system (Poky).
                        After Yocto Project Version 1.0, the Yocto Project
                        and OpenEmbedded agreed to work together and share a

            This section provides an introduction to the choices or
            development methods you have when setting up your Build Host.
            Depending on the your particular workflow preference and the
            type of operating system your Build Host runs, several choices
            exist that allow you to use the Yocto Project.

        <para>
            To use the Yocto Project tools, you can use Git to clone (download)
            the Poky repository then use your local copy of the reference
            distribution to bootstrap your own distribution.
            <note>
                Poky does not contain binary files.
                It is a working example of how to build your own custom Linux distribution
                from source.

        <para>
            Poky has a regular, well established, six-month release cycle
            under its own version.
            Major releases occur at the same time major releases (point
            releases) occur for the Yocto Project, which are typically in the
            Spring and Fall.
            For more information on the Yocto Project release schedule and
            cadence, see the
            "<ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-release-process'>Yocto Project Releases and the Stable Release Process</ulink>"

        </para>

        <para>
            Much has been said about Poky being a "default configuration."
            A default configuration provides a starting image footprint.
            You can use Poky out of the box to create an image ranging from a
            shell-accessible minimal image all the way up to a Linux
            Standard Base-compliant image that uses a GNOME Mobile and
            Embedded (GMAE) based reference user interface called Sato.
        </para>

        <para>
            One of the most powerful properties of Poky is that every aspect
            of a build is controlled by the metadata.
            You can use metadata to augment these base image types by
            adding metadata
            <link linkend='the-yocto-project-layer-model'>layers</link>
            that extend functionality.
            These layers can provide, for example, an additional software
            stack for an image type, add a board support package (BSP) for
            additional hardware, or even create a new image type.
        </para>

        <para>
            Metadata is loosely grouped into configuration files or package
            recipes.
            A recipe is a collection of non-executable metadata used by
            BitBake to set variables or define additional build-time tasks.
            A recipe contains fields such as the recipe description, the recipe
            version, the license of the package and the upstream source
            repository.
            A recipe might also indicate that the build process uses autotools,
            make, distutils or any other build process, in which case the basic
            functionality can be defined by the classes it inherits from
            the OE-Core layer's class definitions in
            <filename>./meta/classes</filename>.
            Within a recipe you can also define additional tasks as well as
            task prerequisites.
            Recipe syntax through BitBake also supports both
            <filename>_prepend</filename> and <filename>_append</filename>
            operators as a method of extending task functionality.
            These operators inject code into the beginning or end of a task.
            For information on these BitBake operators, see the
            "<ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_BB_URL;#appending-and-prepending-override-style-syntax'>Appending and Prepending (Override Style Syntax)</ulink>"

                    A collection of related recipes.
                    Layers allow you to consolidate related metadata to
                    customize your build.
                    Layers also isolate information used when building
                    for multiple architectures.
                    Layers are hierarchical in their ability to override
                    previous specifications.
                    You can include any number of available layers from the
                    Yocto Project and customize the build by adding your
                    layers after them.
                    You can search the Layer Index for layers used within
                    Yocto Project.</para>

                    <emphasis>Metadata:</emphasis>
                    A key element of the Yocto Project is the Metadata that
                    is used to construct a Linux distribution and is contained
                    in the files that the OpenEmbedded build system parses
                    when building an image.
                    In general, Metadata includes recipes, configuration
                    files, and other information that refers to the build
                    instructions themselves, as well as the data used to
                    control what things get built and the effects of the
                    build.
                    Metadata also includes commands and data used to
                    indicate what versions of software are used, from
                    where they are obtained, and changes or additions to the
                    software itself (patches or auxiliary files) that
                    are used to fix bugs or customize the software for use
                    in a particular situation.
                    OpenEmbedded-Core is an important set of validated
                    metadata.

                    <emphasis>OpenEmbedded Build System:</emphasis>
                    The terms "BitBake" and "build system" are sometimes
                    used for the OpenEmbedded Build System.</para>

                    <para>BitBake is a task scheduler and execution engine
                    that parses instructions (i.e. recipes) and configuration
                    data.
                    After a parsing phase, BitBake creates a dependency tree
                    to order the compilation, schedules the compilation of
                    the included code, and finally executes the building
                    of the specified custom Linux image (distribution).
                    BitBake is similar to the <filename>make</filename>
                    tool.</para>

                    <para>During a build process, the build system tracks
                    dependencies and performs a native or cross-compilation
                    of the package.
                    As a first step in a cross-build setup, the framework
                    attempts to create a cross-compiler toolchain
                    (i.e. Extensible SDK) suited for the target platform.

                    <emphasis>OpenEmbedded-Core (OE-Core):</emphasis>
                    OE-Core is metadata comprised of foundation recipes,
                    classes, and associated files that are meant to be
                    common among many different OpenEmbedded-derived systems,
                    including the Yocto Project.
                    OE-Core is a curated subset of an original repository
                    developed by the OpenEmbedded community that has been
                    pared down into a smaller, core set of continuously
                    validated recipes.
                    The result is a tightly controlled and quality-assured
                    core set of recipes.</para>

                    <para>You can see the Metadata in the

                    <emphasis>Packages:</emphasis>
                    In the context of the Yocto Project, this term refers to a
                    recipe's packaged output produced by BitBake (i.e. a
                    "baked recipe").
                    A package is generally the compiled binaries produced from the
                    recipe's sources.
                    You "bake" something by running it through BitBake.</para>

                    <para>It is worth noting that the term "package" can,
                    in general, have subtle meanings.
                    For example, the packages referred to in the
                    "<ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#required-packages-for-the-build-host'>Required Packages for the Build Host</ulink>"
                    section in the Yocto Project Reference Manual are compiled
                    binaries that, when installed, add functionality to your
                    Linux distribution.</para>

                    <para>Another point worth noting is that historically within
                    the Yocto Project, recipes were referred to as packages - thus,
                    the existence of several BitBake variables that are seemingly
                    mis-named,
                    (e.g. <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-PR'><filename>PR</filename></ulink>,

                    Poky is not a product level distro.

                    used to build the binary image.
                    A recipe describes where you get source code and which
                    patches to apply.
                    Recipes describe dependencies for libraries or for other
                    recipes as well as configuration and compilation options.
                    Related recipes are consolidated into a layer.
