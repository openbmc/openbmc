<title>Using the Quick EMUlator (QEMU)</title>

    <para>
        The Yocto Project uses an implementation of the Quick EMUlator (QEMU)
        Open Source project as part of the Yocto Project development "tool
        set".
        This chapter provides both procedures that show you how to use the
        Quick EMUlator (QEMU) and other QEMU information helpful for
        development purposes.

        <title>Overview</title>

        <para>
            Within the context of the Yocto Project, QEMU is an
            emulator and virtualization machine that allows you to run a
            complete image you have built using the Yocto Project as just
            another task on your build system.
            QEMU is useful for running and testing images and applications on
            supported Yocto Project architectures without having actual
            hardware.
            Among other things, the Yocto Project uses QEMU to run automated
            Quality Assurance (QA) tests on final images shipped with each
            release.
            <note>
                This implementation is not the same as QEMU in general.
            </note>
            This section provides a brief reference for the Yocto Project
            implementation of QEMU.

        <title>Running QEMU</title>

        <para>
            To use QEMU, you need to have QEMU installed and initialized as
            well as have the proper artifacts (i.e. image files and root
            filesystems) available.
            Follow these general steps to run QEMU:

                    QEMU is made available with the Yocto Project a number of
                    ways.
                    One method is to install a Software Development Kit (SDK).

                    <emphasis>Run QEMU:</emphasis>
                    The basic <filename>runqemu</filename> command syntax is as
                    follows:
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ runqemu [<replaceable>option</replaceable> ]  [...]
                    </literallayout>
                    Based on what you provide on the command line,
                    <filename>runqemu</filename> does a good job of figuring
                    out what you are trying to do.
                    For example, by default, QEMU looks for the most recently
                    built image according to the timestamp when it needs to
                    look for an image.
                    Minimally, through the use of options, you must provide
                    either a machine name, a virtual machine image
                    (<filename>*wic.vmdk</filename>), or a kernel image
                    (<filename>*.bin</filename>).</para>

                    <para>Here are some additional examples to help illustrate
                    further QEMU:
                    <itemizedlist>
                        <listitem><para>
                            This example starts QEMU with
                            <replaceable>MACHINE</replaceable> set to "qemux86-64".
                            Assuming a standard
                            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#build-directory'>Build Directory</ulink>,
                            <filename>runqemu</filename> automatically finds the
                            <filename>bzImage-qemux86-64.bin</filename> image file and
                            the
                            <filename>core-image-minimal-qemux86-64-20200218002850.rootfs.ext4</filename>
                            (assuming the current build created a
                            <filename>core-image-minimal</filename> image).
                            <note>
                            When more than one image with the same name exists, QEMU finds
                            and uses the most recently built image according to the
                            timestamp.

                            This command, however, specifically provides the image

        <title>Switching Between Consoles</title>

        <para>
            When booting or running QEMU, you can switch between
            supported consoles by using
            Ctrl+Alt+<replaceable>number</replaceable>.
            For example, Ctrl+Alt+3 switches you to the serial console
            as long as that console is enabled.
            Being able to switch consoles is helpful, for example, if
            the main QEMU console breaks for some reason.
            <note>
                Usually, "2" gets you to the main console and "3"
                gets you to the serial console.

        <title>Disabling the Cursor Grab</title>

        <para>
            The default QEMU integration captures the cursor within the
            main window.
            It does this since standard mouse devices only provide
            relative input and not absolute coordinates.
            You then have to break out of the grab using the "Ctrl+Alt"
            key combination.
            However, the Yocto Project's integration of QEMU enables
            the wacom USB touch pad driver by default to allow input
            of absolute coordinates.
            This default means that the mouse can enter and leave the
            main window without the grab taking effect leading to a
            better user experience.

        <title>Running Under a Network File System (NFS) Server</title>

        <para>
            One method for running QEMU is to run it on an NFS server.
            This is useful when you need to access the same file system
            from both the build and the emulated system at the same time.
            It is also worth noting that the system does not need root
            privileges to run.
            It uses a user space NFS server to avoid that.
            Follow these steps to set up for running QEMU using an NFS
            server.

        <title>QEMU CPU Compatibility Under KVM</title>

        <para>
            By default, the QEMU build compiles for and targets 64-bit and x86
            <trademark class='registered'>Intel</trademark> <trademark class='trademark'>Core</trademark>2
            Duo processors and 32-bit x86
            <trademark class='registered'>Intel</trademark> <trademark class='registered'>Pentium</trademark>
            II processors.
            QEMU builds for and targets these CPU types because they display
            a broad range of CPU feature compatibility with many commonly
            used CPUs.
        </para>

        <para>
            Despite this broad range of compatibility, the CPUs could support
            a feature that your host CPU does not support.
            Although this situation is not a problem when QEMU uses software
            emulation of the feature, it can be a problem when QEMU is
            running with KVM enabled.
            Specifically, software compiled with a certain CPU feature crashes
            when run on a CPU under KVM that does not support that feature.
            To work around this problem, you can override QEMU's runtime CPU
            setting by changing the <filename>QB_CPU_KVM</filename>
            variable in <filename>qemuboot.conf</filename> in the
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#build-directory'>Build Directory's</ulink>
            <filename>deploy/image</filename> directory.
            This setting specifies a <filename>-cpu</filename> option
            passed into QEMU in the <filename>runqemu</filename> script.
            Running <filename>qemu -cpu help</filename> returns a list of
            available supported CPU types.

        <title>QEMU Performance</title>

        <para>
            Using QEMU to emulate your hardware can result in speed issues
            depending on the target and host architecture mix.
            For example, using the <filename>qemux86</filename> image in the
            emulator on an Intel-based 32-bit (x86) host machine is fast
            because the target and host architectures match.
            On the other hand, using the <filename>qemuarm</filename> image
            on the same Intel-based host can be slower.
            But, you still achieve faithful emulation of ARM-specific issues.
        </para>

        <para>
            To speed things up, the QEMU images support using
            <filename>distcc</filename> to call a cross-compiler outside the
            emulated system.
            If you used <filename>runqemu</filename> to start QEMU, and the
            <filename>distccd</filename> application is present on the host
            system, any BitBake cross-compiling toolchain available from the
            build system is automatically used from within QEMU simply by
            calling <filename>distcc</filename>.
            You can accomplish this by defining the cross-compiler variable
            (e.g. <filename>export CC="distcc"</filename>).
            Alternatively, if you are using a suitable SDK image or the
            appropriate stand-alone toolchain is present, the toolchain is
            also automatically used.
            <note>
                Several mechanisms exist that let you connect to the system

     $ runqemu [<replaceable>option</replaceable> ]  [...]
            </literallayout>
            Based on what you provide on the command line,
            <filename>runqemu</filename> does a good job of figuring out what
            you are trying to do.
            For example, by default, QEMU looks for the most recently built
            image according to the timestamp when it needs to look for an
            image.
            Minimally, through the use of options, you must provide either
            a machine name, a virtual machine image
            (<filename>*wic.vmdk</filename>), or a kernel image
            (<filename>*.bin</filename>).

     $ runqemu --help

     Usage: you can run this script with any valid combination
     of the following environment variables (in any order):
       KERNEL - the kernel image file to use
       ROOTFS - the rootfs image file or nfsroot directory to use
       MACHINE - the machine name (optional, autodetected from KERNEL filename if unspecified)
       Simplified QEMU command-line options can be passed with:
         nographic - disable video console
         serial - enable a serial console on /dev/ttyS0
         slirp - enable user networking, no root privileges is required
         kvm - enable KVM when running x86/x86_64 (VT-capable CPU required)
         kvm-vhost - enable KVM with vhost when running x86/x86_64 (VT-capable CPU required)
         publicvnc - enable a VNC server open to all hosts
         audio - enable audio
         [*/]ovmf* - OVMF firmware file or base name for booting with UEFI
       tcpserial=&lt;port&gt; - specify tcp serial port number
       biosdir=&lt;dir&gt; - specify custom bios dir
       biosfilename=&lt;filename&gt; - specify bios filename
       qemuparams=&lt;xyz&gt; - specify custom parameters to QEMU
       bootparams=&lt;xyz&gt; - specify custom kernel parameters during boot
       help, -h, --help: print this text
