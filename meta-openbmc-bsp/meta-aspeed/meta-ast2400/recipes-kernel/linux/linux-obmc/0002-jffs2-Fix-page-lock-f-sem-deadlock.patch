Subject: [PATCH 2/2] jffs2: Fix page lock / f->sem deadlock
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

With this fix, all code paths should now be obtaining the page lock before
f->sem.

 	JFFS2 LOCKING DOCUMENTATION
 	---------------------------
 
-At least theoretically, JFFS2 does not require the Big Kernel Lock
-(BKL), which was always helpfully obtained for it by Linux 2.4 VFS
-code. It has its own locking, as described below.
-
 This document attempts to describe the existing locking rules for
 JFFS2. It is not expected to remain perfectly up to date, but ought to
 be fairly close.

 	   No ordering rules have been made for doing so.
